A suicide bomber struck in the federal capital after nearly a year-and-a-half , killing one person and injuring at least six when he was stopped by the security guard of a private bank . But for the timely action of the guard , there would have been more fatalities as the interior of the bank and the commercial plaza where it was located suffered extensive damage . According to the police , the teenaged suicide bomber detonated himself when he was stopped by the guard from entering the bank premises on the periphery of the federal capital . Many vehicles were also damaged . With Saturday night 's twin bombings in Peshawar fresh in memory , police cordoned off the area . In Peshawar , it was the second blast which consumed more lives , including that of two journalists and some security personnel . This is the first instance of a suicide blast in Islamabad in 18 months . On Sunday , three people were injured in a minor blast on the outskirts of the capital and the city had been rocked by a couple of loud unexplained explosions that caused no injury in April 2010 .
