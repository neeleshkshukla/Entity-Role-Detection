In a swift operation on Monday night , the Bangalore police , assisted by the Tamil Nadu state intelligence , arrested two persons here for their alleged involvement in the Bangalore bomb blast on April 17 , which left 17 persons injured . Police sources said Basheer of Tirunenveli and Peer Mohideen of Bangalore were arrested from a hideout at Flower Bazaar here . The arrest is very important as they played a vital role in the blast . Preliminary inquiries revealed that they are associated with a banned extremist organisation . An analysis of the mobile phone call records of two prime suspects led investigators to Basheer and Mohideen , a police officer said . Parrying questions whether the two persons were present at the crime scene , the officer said the Karnataka police would take the two for further interrogation . Portraits developed The Tamil Nadu police have developed two computer-aided portraits of the two prime suspects . The portraits were based on the inputs given by the seller of a motorcycle allegedly used to cause the blast . A high-level team of the Bangalore police rushed to Chennai late on Sunday to match the portraits with the photographs and video footage available with them . OPEN
