The huge cistern at Mecca Masjid is in for repairs . The mosque authorities have emptied it as it has developed major cracks resulting in the speedy depletion of water . The cistern is used by people for ablutions before offering namaz . During Ramzan the fast depletion of water created problems for worshippers . Therefore , we have decided to repair it properly , said Khaja Nayeemuddin , superintendent , Mecca Masjid . The cistern got damaged in the bomb blast at the mosque in 2007 . Ever since the water was seeping out but of late the cracks widened causing water to deplete quickly . Last Friday the cistern was completely emptied and the tiles removed to plug the leaks .
