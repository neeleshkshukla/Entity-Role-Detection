The inclusion of People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) leader Abdul Nasir Maudany as an accused in the 2008 Bangalore serial bomb blast case is a conspiracy to weaken that case , party working chairman Poonthura Siraj has said . Mr. Siraj was talking to mediapersons from Maudany 's Anwarserry camp , near here , after the party 's central council meeting on Monday . Maundany is innocent and had no hand in the Bangalore blasts . The party will counter the conspiracy legally . An anticipatory bail application will be moved in the Bangalore Sessions Court , he said .
