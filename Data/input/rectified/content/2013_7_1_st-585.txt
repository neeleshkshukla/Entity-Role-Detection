Two bombings killed 21 people in north-western Pakistan on Sunday , just as Britains Prime Minister was in the capital pledging to help to fight extremism . In the deadlier of the two attacks , a car bomb exploded as a convoy of paramilitary troops passed through the outskirts of the northwest city of Peshawar , killing at least 17 people and wounding dozens of others , police said . Most of the dead and wounded were civilians , though nine paramilitary Frontier Corps troops were hurt , said police official Shafiullah Khan . The blast struck one Frontier Corps vehicle , but the other passed by safely . The explosion damaged many other vehicles and shops , according to local TV video . Frontier Corps vehicles rushed to the scene , and a police officer collected evidence from the crater caused by the bomb . A roadside bomb struck an army convoy and killed four soldiers in the North Waziristan tribal area , the main sanctuary for Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in the country . The blast also wounded 20 soldiers , the officials said .
