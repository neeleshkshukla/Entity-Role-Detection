Principal Secretary ( Home ) Alok Sinha told a hurriedly called press conference that security agencies probing the blasts have been able to `` uncover '' that the LeT terrorist , who was shot dead in an encounter with the Special Task Force of the state police near the state capital , was involved in them . . . `` Prima facie , it appears that the slain terrorist was involved in the twin blasts but it would be a matter of investigation to ascertain the degree of his involvement or whether he was the mastermind , '' Sinha said . . .
