Two suicide bombers blew up cars rigged with explosives near a military compound and a hotel in a city in northwestern Syria on Monday , killing at least nine people and wounding nearly 100 , state media said . The blasts , which also tore two large craters in the ground , were the latest setback for troubled United Nations efforts to end Syria 's 13-month-old crisis . A team of U.N. observers is already on the ground to salvage a cease-fire that went into effect on April 12 but has been widely ignored by both sides . U.N. officials have singled out the regime as the main aggressor in violations of the truce.Monday 's powerful bombs went off in the city of Idlib , an opposition stronghold that government troops recaptured in a military offensive earlier this year . The state-run news agency SANA said security forces and civilians were among those killed , while state TV said that many of the nearly 100 wounded were civilians . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an activist network , put the death toll at more than 20 people . Syria 's pro-government al-Ekhbariya TV aired footage of the aftermath from the blasts , showing torn flesh , smashed cars , twisted debris and blood stains on the pavement . The force of the explosions tore the facade off one multistory building , shattered windows in the area and sent debris flying for hundreds of meters . Pro-government websites said five buildings damaged . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks . State media blamed armed terrorists , a term it uses for rebels trying to topple the government . Activists claimed the regime was behind the bombings to discredit the opposition .
