The editorial also condemned the attack by NCP workers on the Vishwa Hindu Parishad office in Nashik in the wake of of the sadhvi 's arrest . ` Just because NCP controls the home ministry -LRB- in the state -RRB- , we hope they have not got a license to do what they want , ' it said . ` Why did they ever not attack SIMI offices ? NCP member advocate Majid Memon defended the 1993 blasts ' accused . Has anybody ever touched him ?
