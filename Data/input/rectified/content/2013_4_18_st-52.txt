Advisory to States Meanwhile , the MHA issued an advisory to all States asking them to beef up security and enhance deployment of police personnel , particularly in and around sensitive and crowded locations like places of worship , markets and malls . Sources in the MHA said Indian Mujahideen , which is allegedly responsible for recent blasts in Hyderabad and Pune , could be behind the Bangalore blast . Though it is too early to name any organisation , the evidence gathered so far by probe agencies indicates that it could be the handiwork of the Indian Mujahideen . The use of improvised explosive device and ammonium nitrate is what the banned outfit had used in the past as well , the sources said .
