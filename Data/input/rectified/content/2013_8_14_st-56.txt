A special TADA court on Tuesday allowed the CBI to drop certain charges against extradited gangster Abu Salem in connection with the 1993 serial bomb blasts case . The CBI had earlier told the Supreme Court that it wanted to withdraw certain charges under the TADA Act , among other Acts , in view of its commitment to the Portugal government . At the time of 45-year-old Salem extradition , India had assured Portugal that no charges entailing death penalty or imprisonment of more than 25 years would be pressed against him but such charges were later brought in .
