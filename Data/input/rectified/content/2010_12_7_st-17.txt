Nijjar allowed the appeals of Kaza Nizamuddin , Hyder Ali and Abubucker Siddique , challenging the life sentence and dismissed the CBI 's appeals questioning the acquittal of some of the accused by the TADA court . The prosecution case was that on August 6 , 1993 there were loud explosions , which resulted in the death of 11 persons , injuries to 7 others and complete demolition of the building . Writing the judgment , Justice Reddy said , Excepting for the confessional statements , admittedly , there is no other independent evidence with regard to the participation of the accused in the conspiracy and the particular role played by them .

Natarajan and counsel G. Balaji appearing for the appellants said that the confessional statements reveals that what was purchased was only gelatin sticks from Gudiyatham and not RDX or PETN .
