A massive explosion was heard near Gao in northern Mali late Saturday , hours after villagers near the city detained two youths preparing for suicide bombings . A French military source said the blast occurred some 10 km away from the French military base at the citys airport , but could provide no further details . An AFP correspondent said the blast was audible from Gao , the main city in northern Mali which was only recaptured from the Islamists late last month . The city was already on edge after what is thought to have been Malis first suicide attack on Friday , when a young Tuareg blew himself up , slightly injuring a Malian soldier . Malian troops reinforced checkpoints with sandbags and heavy machine-guns and stepped patrols . Then on Saturday morning , residents of a village near Gao detained two young men they said were carrying explosive belts on the road leading to the site of Fridays attack . The attacks came as reports said the bodies of several people , including three Arab shopkeepers arrested by troops , had been discovered in a grave in Timbuktu . Timbuktu has been the scene of reprisal attacks by black Malians against Arab and Tuareg residents accused of supporting the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist rebels who until recently occupied the city .
