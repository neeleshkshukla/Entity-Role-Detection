At least 14 people including Rangers personnel providing security were injured in the firing . The procession was targeted en route elsewhere but faced casualties only in the Sorab Koth area . In court Meanwhile , the Supreme Court of Pakistan took suo motu notice of the targeted attack on the Shia community in Karachi and posted the case for hearing on Wednesday . Last month , the Court had taken similar notice of the targeted killing of Hazara Shias in Quetta where nearly 200 members of the community have been killed this year alone . Sundays blast ripped through two apartment blocks ; rendering several people homeless . Through Sunday night and Monday , people were using every platform available to organise alternate accommodation and basic necessities for those whose homes had been destroyed in the explosion . No organisation has claimed responsibility for the blast in a city that is no stranger to violence . As is invariably the case when tension escalates in Karachi , the provincial government banned pillion riding from Monday night and announced an operation against banned organisations .
