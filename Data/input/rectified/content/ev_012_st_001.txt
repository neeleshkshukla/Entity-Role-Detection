Eight wagons of an empty goods train derailed between the Safrai and Lakwa stations of the Northeast Frontier Railway ( NFR ) in Upper Assam around 3.35 a.m. today when suspected ULFA militants blasted a bomb on the track . Luckily , there was no casualty . Senior NFR officials at the Maligaon headquarters here said the blast created a crater three feet deep and four feet wide . Police found a 138-metre long wire leading into a nearby tea garden from where the bomb seems to have been detonated . A metal container which is supposed to have contained the explosive charge was found near the blast site . Empty packets of dry food recovered from the tea garden suggest that the militants had bided their time through the night , police said .
