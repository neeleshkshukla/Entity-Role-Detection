At least 12 people were killed and over 100 wounded in a double car bombing in Russia 's North Caucasus , the deadliest militant strike for months in the troubled region , officials said on Friday . The massive blasts outside the main city of Dagestan sent huge yellow flames into the night sky , reduced cars to burned wreckage and ripped a crater into the ground , television pictures showed . Investigators said the first blast went off on the outskirts of the city of Makhachkala in the republic of Dagestan when a Lada car laden with explosives was detonated near a traffic police post damaging nearby buildings and cars but causing no fatalities . The second car bomb went off fifteen minutes later hitting policemen , rescue workers and passers-by who gathered at the scene , investigators said . The twin attacks appeared to bear the hallmarks of bombings conducted by radical militants fighting the Kremlin in the Caucasus where they seek to establish an Islamist state . The blasts were by far the deadliest attacks in the Caucasus this year and deal a huge blow to Kremlin hopes of restoring relative stability to a region that has been a headache for Moscow since the collapse of the former USSR .
