Iraq on Tuesday was rocked by a nationwide string of bombings that killed at least 43 people and put on edge authorities who are set to host next week the Arab summit a symbol of the country 's diplomatic resurgence after years of conflict . An explosion in Baghdad targeted the Foreign Ministry , where dozens of employees have been working round the clock for the summit . The car blast killed three people outside the Ministry but failed to breach the outer security perimeter of the building . The bombing was a grisly reminder of the attack on the Foreign and Finance ministries in 2009 that killed scores of people . Another attack in the capital 's Allawi neighbourhood killed five Shia pilgrims . Tuesday 's bombings appeared indiscriminate , targeting Shia pilgrims , a Sunni stronghold in Anbar province , civilians and security personnel . They also took place on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq led by the United States . Karbala , a major Shia pilgrim centre , was badly hit when a car bomb exploded at Baghdad Gate square . Thirteen pilgrims , including four from Iran , were killed . Explosions also rocked Hilla and Samarra , both Shia dominated cities , and the Al Anbar province , where the concentration of Sunnis is higher . At least 10 security personnel were killed in Kirkuk , which sits over huge reserves of oil whose control has been the source of conflict among the area 's ethnically and religiously divided communities . The attack took place in the early hours when the shift of personnel stationed overnight was changing .
