The government has declared the Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , suspected to be a shadow outfit of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) and Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Taiba , a terrorist outfit . The IM is allegedly involved in the serial bomb blasts in Delhi , Uttar Pradesh , Bangalore and Mumbai . It has been added to the list of terror groups under the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , 1967 . An order has been issued adding the Indian Mujahideen and all its formations and front organisations to the list of Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , 1967 , the Home Ministry said in a statement on Friday . Under the Act , the government has banned 34 groups and declared them terror outfits . The IM came to light after the February 23 , 2005 blast in Varanasi . Its hand was suspected in the incident . In 2008 , it was allegedly involved in many terror attacks . Intelligence agencies believe that the outfit is also a front group of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami ( HuJI ) . A sleeper cell of the IM was suspected to be behind the Pune blast earlier this year in which two foreign nationals and seven others were killed and 60 injured . The attack at the German Bakery in Pune was similar to the group 's earlier strikes in Bangalore , Ahmedabad and New Delhi in 2008 , say sources in intelligence agencies .
