The death toll from violence in Nigeria has risen to at least 41 following a series of bomb blasts , attacks on churches and reprisals , police said on Monday , as soldiers patrolled to prevent further unrest . Many houses were also burnt when clashes broke out on Sunday in the wake of Christmas Eve bomb blasts in the central city of Jos that killed dozens , said state police commissioner Abdulrahman Akano . But he denied a community leader 's claim that 14 bodies had been recovered following Sunday 's clashes . The community leader also said 23 houses were found burnt along with a church and a mosque . My records show three killed , Mr. Akano told AFP of Sunday 's violence . He was vague on how many buildings were burnt and declined to provide further details . Mohammed Shittu , a leader in the Hausa Muslim community in Jos who headed a search and rescue team , said 14 bodies were recovered and 23 houses were burnt following Sunday 's clashes . He said another 33 people were wounded . A mass burial was being prepared for the victims , he said . Christian leaders in the area could not immediately provide numbers of victims . At least 32 people were killed and 74 wounded when seven explosions went off in two different areas of Jos on Friday evening , with many of the victims doing their Christmas shopping at the time . A church was also targeted , the governor has said . Jos is in the so-called middle-belt region between the predominantly Muslim north and the mainly Christian south and has long been a hotspot of ethnic and religious friction in Nigeria .
