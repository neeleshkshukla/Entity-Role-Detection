Even as investigations are on into Tuesday 's Varanasi bomb blast , three crude bombs were discovered in Allahabad , about 120 km from Varanasi , on Thursday . The low-intensity bombs were defused by a bomb disposal squad . Though the situation in Allahabad was described as normal , vigil has been stepped up . Uttar Pradesh Additional Director-General ( Law and Order ) Brij Lal said the crude bombs , wrapped in polythene , were kept in a waste disposal cart in a lane in Chak Bahadurganj . In the Varanasi blast case , the forensic team returned to Agra after collecting material from the Shitla Ghat site . The results are expected to be known on Friday , Mr. Lal said . Though the blast probe had been transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Squad , a team of the National Investigation Agency and some Central government experts were also in Varanasi in connection with the investigation , he said . Mr. Lal said there was no breakthrough in the case and no information on the involvement of any person or terrorist organisation in the blast . About the suspected mastermind , Shahnawaz , and the alleged involvement of the Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , Mr. Lal said some IM members from Azamgarh were wanted in some cases , but their involvement in Tuesday 's blast was yet to be proved . Unconfirmed reports have stated that the police raided some places in Azamgarh district on Tuesday and Wednesday in a bid to find crucial leads . Reports also said a red corner notice had been issued against Dr. Shahnawaz .
