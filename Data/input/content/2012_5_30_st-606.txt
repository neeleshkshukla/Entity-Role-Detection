Former MLA and YSR Congress party leader Vangaveeti Radhakrishna has challenged the Congress Government and Vijayawada MP Lagadapati Rajagopal to come up with a probe into the alleged bombing incident at one of the guest houses of the MP . At a press conference here on Tuesday , Mr. Radha promised to reveal the names of the people involved in the blast , source of the explosive material and from which mines/quarries they were taken . I will not reveal the names in a press conference , but if a sitting judge seeks the names , I will reveal them and also produce documents to support my allegations so that the real guilty could be put behind bars , Mr . Radha said . These blasts were done by some people very close to the Vijayawada MP and now there is a conspiracy to blame it on the YSR Congress party workers , he added . Mr. Rajagopal wants to become the Pradesh Congress Committee President by dislodging Botcha Satyanarayana , he alleged . The Congress Party has not allowed the YSR Congress party leaders and workers to come out of the their houses and campaign for their candidates or protest against the arrest of their leader YS Jagan , which shows how much they fear the YSR Congress , he said . The YSR Congress party will sweep all the seats and there will be more sympathy wave for YS Jagan after his arrest he said . OPEN
