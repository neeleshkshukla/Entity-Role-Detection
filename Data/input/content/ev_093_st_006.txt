NEW DELHI : The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- has claimed to have solved the July 7 Bodh Gaya blasts conspiracy with the recovery of a document from Ranchi that details the entire planning , including the placement of each of the 13 bombs and the planters associated with them . The NIA , which recovered 27 bombs from a lodge in Hindpidih area of Ranchi on Monday , also found a chart in the room that listed the men who allegedly planted 13 bombs in the temple complex of Bodh Gaya . The document shows that the blasts were planned by Indian Mujahideen 's Tehsin Akhtar and Haidar Ali and included the same planters as in the October 27 Patna blasts . It also includes the name of Imtiaz Ansari , arrested after one of the Patna bombs exploded at the city railway station . Ansari had denied any involvement in the Bodh Gaya blasts but had conceded that it had been planned by Tehsin . The chart 's matrix reveals Imtiaz had planted bombs near the Thai Monastery in Bodh Gaya . His accomplice Ainul alias Tarique , who was injured while planting bombs at Patna station and later died , had planted bombs at the Targhar Monastery . Mujib , who was staying in the hotel room which was raided on Monday , had planted bombs in four places in Bodh Gaya . A senior officer privy to investigation details said , ` This shows that Imtiaz is still hiding several things about IM 's activities . With the recovery of these documents , the Bodh Gaya puzzle has been solved . We are now in the process of evidence collection and looking for the absconding accused . We will further interrogate Ansari . ' .
