The police located all three persons who had used the bike since it was first sold . They were being questioned , Mr. Shinde told journalists here on Thursday . We have not come to any conclusion about the people behind the blast . Investigation is such a matter that we can not say we can do within a definite period of time . But I assure the nation that we will book the culprits , we will book the perpetrators . The Minister said the Centre had been alerting all States for the last two-three months about possible terror attacks , particularly in metro cities .
