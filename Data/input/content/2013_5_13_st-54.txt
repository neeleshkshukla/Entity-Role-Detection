Explosive material used in making firecrackers are said to have caused the explosion in a State Transport bus in Maharashtras Latur district that left more than a dozen people injured . State Home Minister R. R. Patil , who visited the site of the incident on Sunday , said that there was no reason to suspect any terrorist hand in the blast as preliminary inquiries did not yield any splinters , wires or timer device from the spot of the incident , discounting the possibility of an Improvised Explosive Device in the explosion . The blast is clearly due to the explosive material used in manufacturing firecrackers . Further no traces of RDX or any other high-end explosive material used for making bombs have been found , said Mr. Patil in Latur , even as teams of the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad ( ATS ) rushed to the district .
