With indiscriminate violence having arrived in Damascus , India is thinning down its mission in Syria and evacuating family members of those who will remain . In the haven for expatriates from nearby countries , there are , however , few Indians and those who have remained are being asked to leave by available flights , External Affairs Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said at a news briefing here on Tuesday . We are advising the Indians to leave the country . After an assessment of the security situation , the families of embassy staff are being evacuated , he said . Although Syria is home to displaced Palestinians and Iraqis , besides people of many other nationalities and faiths , there were only 900 Indians when powerful bomb blasts starting rocking Damascus . Now there are about 100 left including the embassy staff and a few from Mother Teresas Missionaries of Charity . Last week , the Government issued a travel advisory warning Indians against visiting the country , where attacks against unarmed civilians by the Free Syrian Army and some shadowy groups have escalated in their struggle against the Bashar al-Assad regime . A bomb attack last week claimed the lives of Syrian Defence Minister and Mr. Assad 's brother-in-law . OPEN
