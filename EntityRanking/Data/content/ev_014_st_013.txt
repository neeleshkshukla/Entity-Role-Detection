Life came to a standstill in the Brahmaputra Valley with traders downing their shutters ; education institutions , banks and other financial institutions remained closed . . . The roads in the city and districts wore a deserted look with public and private vehicles remaining off the road . Although trains and flights were running normally , passengers were stranded at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bardoloi International Airport at Borjhar and Guwahati railway stations as no taxis or other public transport was available . . . Attendance in Government offices , particularly the State Secretariat at Dispur , was thin . The State-run Assam Transport Corporation did not ply any buses in the city . . . Students burnt tyres in the Panabazar locality to prevent the movement of vehicles .

Condemning the ULFA for the attack on the schoolchildren , the AASU held the State Government responsible for their deaths . . . The student body accused the State Government of failing to protect the lives and property of the people and demanded that the Chief Minister , Tarun Gogoi , resign owning moral responsibility .
