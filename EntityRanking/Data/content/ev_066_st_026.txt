The police had earlier picked up a Pakistani , Zahid , for questioning . However , he was released on Saturday after verification of his antecedents . . . Zahid told the police that he was to return to Lahore along with his mother and younger brother by the Samjhauta Express on Sunday night , but due to a quarrel with his brother at the old Delhi station , he changed his plans and returned to Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh . . . Meanwhile , efforts of the Special Cell of the Delhi police to find out the place from where the suitcases , used for planting the bombs , had been purchased have not yielded any results .
