More than a dozen bombings ripped through Shia neighbourhoods in and around Baghdad on Wednesday , killing 59 people across Iraq . More than 600 lives have been claimed this month so far . Residents in one neighbourhood angrily reacted to one blast by chasing down a suspected attacker and killing him before setting his corpse ablaze . The unrest came despite widely publicised security operations targeting militants . The spike in violence since the beginning of the year , with more than 3,700 people killed , has sparked concerns about a return to the brutal sectarian war that plagued Iraq in 2006 and 2007 .
