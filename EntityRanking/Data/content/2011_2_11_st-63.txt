The Karnataka High Court on Thursday asked the State to furnish details of mobile phone and telephonic conversations that Kerala PDP leader Abdul Nasir Maudany allegedly had with terrorists . Justice V. Jagannathan passed the order after Advocate-General ( AG ) Ashok Harnahalli , appearing for the State , opposed bail to Maudany . Mr. Harnahalli said that Maudany had mobile phone and telephonic conversations with several accused in the serial bomb blasts that rocked Bangalore in July 2008 . He said that Maudany knew about the Bangalore blasts and that he has been arraigned as one of the accused in the case . Mr. Harnahalli said that the State had filed a 160-page objection to the petition by Maudany . Justice Jagannathan asked the State to produce the mobile phone records of conversations that Maudany supposedly had with terrorists and adjourned the case to Friday . OPEN
