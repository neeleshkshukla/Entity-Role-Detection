Baloch militants on Saturday blasted a 121-year-old building used by Pakistans founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah at Ziarat and raked it with gunfire , triggering a fire that blazed for four hours , destroying furniture and memorabilia . A policeman was killed in the shooting . Militants of the Balochistan Liberation Army ( BLA ) set off five bombs in the Quaid-e-Azam Residency and then fired at the building at 1.15 a.m. . They removed a Pakistani flag and raised the flag of their outfit in its place , Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said . Five militants were involved in the attack . Television channels , showing footage of the collapsed building , reported that the BLA claimed responsibility for the attack . District police chief Asghar Ali said a bomb disposal squad defused six more bombs , each filled with three kg of explosives . It took longer than expected for the fire to be put out as there were no fire tenders at Ziarat , a holiday resort , and one had to be summoned from the provincial capital Quetta , which is 120 km away . Security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search . The Residency , built in 1892 , was originally used as the summer residence of the Agent of the British Governor-General . Jinnah spent the last days of his life there as he suffered from tuberculosis . It was later declared a national monument . PTI OPEN
