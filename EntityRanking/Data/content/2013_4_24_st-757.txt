A car bomb hit the France embassy in Libya , wounding two French guards and causing extensive damage in the first attack on a foreign mission since militants stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September . The Libyan foreign minister called the attack in Tripoli a `` terrorist '' incident . An AFP correspondent at the site said the wall surrounding the property was destroyed and the embassy building extensively damaged . Two cars parked near the embassy were also destroyed . The explosion occurred around 7:00 am ( 0500 GMT ) , residents said . A French source confirmed an attack against the embassy and said one guard was seriously wounded and another lightly hurt . The mission is located in a two-storey villa in the upmarket Gargaresh area . `` We heard a loud blast at 7:00 am . It was a big mistake to site the French embassy in our neighbourhood , '' said a local resident.France condemned the `` odious '' attack . `` In liaison with the Libyan authorities , the services of the state will do everything to establish the circumstances of this odious act and rapidly identify the perpetrators , '' Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement . The impact of the explosion also severely damaged two villas near the embassy , while windows of a shop 200 metres away were blown out . The street in front of the mission was flooded with water , apparently from a pipe ripped by the blast . Motive , unclear Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdel Aziz condemned the bombing as a `` terrorist act , '' but decline to speculate on who carried it out or what the motive was.AFP OPEN
