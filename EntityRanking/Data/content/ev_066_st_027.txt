Devesh K. Pandey . . NEW DELHI : While clues have started emerging in the Samjhauta Express blasts , the reward money on the suspects who planted the bombs on the train was increased to Rs . 5 lakh on Sunday . . . The Haryana police released modified sketches of the suspects a couple of days ago . . . Investigations by the Haryana police indicated that the bombs were configured at a place close to the Old Delhi railway station , before they were planted in the train . Raw materials used in the bomb and suitcases were brought by different people from different ` directions . ' The police believe that about six identical suitcases were brought for the purpose . . . Though the bombs used appear to be of low-intensity , they are ` highly sophisticated ' in terms of the circuitry used . Their triggering mechanism had stand-by arrangements at three levels to make sure that they exploded in any case . On the basis of these facts , the investigating team believes that at least one of those involved at the execution stage had undergone training in bomb configuration . . . Also , the police have found that the ` GEHI PET-1000 ' bottles used to keep a mixture of inflammable liquid in the suitcases are manufactured in Mumbai . Though such bottles are also found in Andhra Pradesh , the police are at present probing the Mumbai angle . . . The electronic watch found from one of the unexploded bombs , which was manufactured in October-December 2006 , is suspected to have been bought from the Lajpat Rai Market here in the Walled City .
