Barely three days after a blast at the LOC_Event , a powerful explosion rocked a cinema hall in LOC_Event on Sunday night - after peaceful Id festivities throughout the country - killing at least seven persons and injuring about 40 . A 10-year-old child was among those killed . . . Eyewitnesses however claimed there were two blasts in close succession , around 8.30 pm , just after the interval . . . The victims were mainly migrants from other states who were watching a 7 pm show of Bhojpuri film Janam Janam Ka Saath at LOC_Event . There are two more cinema halls in the building . . . The condition of 23 of those injured , admitted to CMC Hospital , was stated to be serious . . . Ludhiana Range DIG Ishwar Singh said the bomb appeared to have been placed in the first three rows of seats . `` At the moment it can not be said if it was RDX or something else , '' he added . The blast site was splattered with blood and body parts and a huge crater marked the spot . . . The Union Home Ministry reacted with caution , saying it needed more information before concluding if this was a terror strike . `` We are monitoring the situation and waiting for more details , '' a spokesperson said . . . What is worrying the security and intelligence machinery is not just that the blast closely follows the LOC_Event explosion but that if it were a terror attack , it would be the first such strike in Punjab in a long time and the very first for Ludhiana , the industrial city that also houses a large number of migrant workers . . . Investigators will also have to determine whether the blast is the handiwork of Islamist terror groups or if a dormant Punjab militant organisation has become active again . . . Former Punjab Director General of Police K P S Gill maintained that planting of explosive devices in a cinema hall meant that it was most likely a terror strike and his suspicions would go to the Babbar Khalsa International or the Khalistan Zindabad Force . . . ... contd . The LOC_Event Police have arrested Ibrahim Moulavi , an accused in the LOC_Event bomb blasts case , near LOC_Event . Page 4 OPEN Officials of the Special Enquiry Squad of Central Crime Branch ( CCB ) interrogated Shahzad , an alleged Indian Mujahideen militant , in connection with the April 17 LOC_Event blasts , here on Friday .

OPEN The charge sheet filed by the Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) of the Rajasthan police against five accused in the 2007 Ajmer dargah blast case on Friday has named senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar as having provided guidance for a conspiracy hatched by radical elements for planting bombs in several cities across the country . Despite pointing the finger at Mr. Kumar for addressing a secret meeting in Jaipur on October 31 , 2005 , the charge sheet , filed in an Ajmer court , has not arraigned him as an accused . It only says the probe is still continuing , though the RSS has denied Mr. Kumar 's involvement . The ATS has not identified the RSS or the radical outfit Abhinav Bharat as being involved in the conspiracy for the blast , drawing flak from activist groups here . They have alleged that the investigating agencies are trying to pre-empt the conclusions about the Sangh Parivar 's direct role in terrorism . The 806-page charge sheet says the office-bearers of some organisations hatched a conspiracy to counter the terror attacks on Hindu religious places and prepared a list of targets where the blasts are to be carried out . These included the Ajmer dargah , the Malegaon mosque and the Makkah Masjid in Hyderabad . Mr. Kumar , says the charge sheet , addressed a secret meeting of radical activists at a guesthouse in Jaipur , where he exhorted them to get affiliated to various religious bodies for completing their mission . This will eliminate the scope for suspicion about their trips to different cities . According to the charge sheet , the main accused in the Ajmer blast case , Sunil Joshi of Indore ( who was later murdered ) ; the prime accused in the Malegaon blast case , Pragnya Singh Thakur ; and four others checked into the guesthouse under fake names for attending the meeting . The roles of different persons were decided at the meeting , with the prime task of carrying out the blast at the time of Iftar ' at Ahata-e-Noor in the dargah assigned to Sunil Joshi , alleges the charge sheet . Lokesh Sharma and Ramji Kalsangare were asked to collect weapons and explosives and carry out a recce . The charge sheet says Devendra Gupta was asked to arrange for a mobile SIM card with fake identity papers , while Sandeep Dange and Sunil Joshi would have to arrange for money for the terror activities . The ATS produced one of the accused , Chandrashekhar , in the court while two others Devendra and Lokesh are in Hyderabad for interrogation in connection with the Makkah Masjid blast . Sandeep and Ramji , who are reportedly absconding , were named as accused . The prosecution appended to the charge sheet 213 support documents as well as a list of 133 witnesses . Chief Judicial Magistrate Jagendra Agrawal took cognisance against Devendra , Chandrashekhar and Lokesh under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code , the Explosives Act and the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act and posted the case to October 26 . OPEN The Paryavarana Parirakshana Sangham ( PPS ) on Wednesday decided to organise a rally in Hyderabad , seeking a CBI probe into the bomb blast in Sompeta two weeks ago . PPS president Y. Krishna Murthy and general secretary B. Dhilli Rao alleged that the government failed to identify the culprits who had planted the bomb in the hospital . The government should arrest the culprits immediately and take stern action against them . It should order a CBI inquiry also to expose the persons behind the conspiracy , they said . They said that the PPS had been making arrangements for the rally in the State Capital along with other civil society groups . The PPS leaders , who have been opposing construction of a power plant in Sompeta , said that they suspect a conspiracy to eliminate the agitators physically so that others would not join the movement . The PPS also decided to stage a rasta roko on the National Highway near Sompeta , as Revenue Minister Dharmana Prasada Rao was scheduled to participate in government functions on October 11 in Itchapuram . OPEN A group of heavily armed Pakistani Taliban militants on Thursday detonated an explosives-laden truck at the office of the Crime Investigation Department ( CID ) , which is spearheading the drive against terrorists in the southern port city of Karachi , killing at least 18 people and injuring 115 others .

Writing the judgment , Justice Reddy said , Excepting for the confessional statements , admittedly , there is no other independent evidence with regard to the participation of the accused in the conspiracy and the particular role played by them . It is apparent that even according to the prosecution version , they could have only carried bombs made from gelatin . The Bench , accepting the arguments of senior counsel R. Natarajan and counsel G. Balaji appearing for the appellants said that the confessional statements reveals that what was purchased was only gelatin sticks from Gudiyatham and not RDX or PETN . OPEN The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad has finally established the Sri Lankan connection in the Pune LOC_Event blast case . Mirza Himayat Inayat Baig , the alleged mastermind , underwent training to assemble explosive devices and cause their explosion ' in Colombo in March 2008 , says the charge sheet filed by the ATS against Baig and six other accused . He was trained by two of the accused , Faiyaz Kagzi and Zabiuddin Ansari . The charge sheet says Kagzi and Ansari gave Baig money or funding the purchase of explosive devices and the travel of indoctrinated Muslim youth to Pakistan for training . After training in Pakistan , Baig returned to India and lived in the non-descript Udgir taluk in Maharashtra 's Latur district under concealed identity as Yusuf ' and Hasan ' . In the last week of January 2010 , on instructions from two of the accused Riyaz Bhatkal and Iqbal Bhatkal , the other two accused Yasin Bhatkal and Mohsin Chowdhary met Baig in Udgir to discuss , finalise and put into execution the plan to cause the bomb explosion at German Bakery , according to the charge sheet .

Thereafter , the duo accompanied Baig to Mumbai , where a haversack and a Nokia 1100 model mobile phone ( which was used to trigger the explosion ) were bought . Yasin and Chowdhary assembled the explosive device at the Global Internet Caf in Udgir . The charge sheet says the three conspirators then travelled to Latur , taking private transport , and again from Udgir to Latur in a state corporation bus on February 13 , the day of the blast . Yasin proceeded to the German Bakery and planted the bomb at about 5 p.m. , and it went off at 6.50 p.m. , killing 17 people . All the accused , including Baig , are part of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India and the Lashkar-e-Taiba , the charge sheet states . Baig is also believed to be an operator of the terror outfit , Indian Mujahideen . The ATS contends that Baig had used his friend Rehman 's bank account to make various transactions from Udgir . He used 25 e-mail IDs to communicate with the other accused , while the plan was being hatched . In pursuance of the conspiracy , ' Baig acquired forged voter cards under two names , Khayum Ayub Shaikh and Immadoddin Ahmed Shaikh , the charge sheet states . He had even a forged handicapped person card . The Latur police said Khurshid Alam , who allegedly helped Baig acquire the forged voter card under the name of Khayum Ayub Shaikh , is on the run .

Natarajan and counsel G. Balaji appearing for the appellants , said the confessional statements reveal that what was purchased was only gelatine sticks from Gudiyatham and not RDX or PETN , which has got a serious bearing on the acceptability of the confessional statements of the accused and their involvement of all the accused in the conspiracy . The lid on the prosecution case is blown away by the report of forensic experts and the traces of the explosive material collected at the bomb site . The prosecution story does not inspire confidence on the basis of the material placed on record , it said .

OPEN Special Correspondent NEW DELHI : India on Monday strongly condemned the twin suicide bomb blasts in LOC_Event earlier in the day , with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh writing to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to assure him of India 's solidarity with the country in combating the forces of violence and terrorism . It is with great anguish that I have learnt of the bomb blasts in LOC_Event , which have led to the loss of so many innocent lives . This is a most tragic and horrific act of violence . At this difficult hour our thoughts are with you , the people of Russia and the families and friends of the victims of this terrible tragedy . On behalf of the Government and people of India , I convey our deepest condolences , Dr. Singh said in the letter to Mr. Medvedev . The Ministry of External Affairs has termed the killing of civilians as targeted violence and hoped the perpetrators of these senseless attacks will be brought to justice . Scourge of terrorism The Government reiterates its conviction that only collective efforts by the international community can combat the scourge of terrorism that the world is facing today , the Foreign Office statement added . External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna said : India condemns these horrendous attacks and my sympathies go out to those who have been killed and who have suffered in this attack . OPEN Vladimir Radyuhin Both stations were packed during the rush hour MOSCOW : The two suicide bomb attacks that killed 38 people and wounded over 60 in Moscow on Monday targeted the city 's busy subway system , a favourite target of Chechen terrorists . In the past six years militants mounted five attacks on the Moscow Metro . In terms of casualties , Monday 's bombings were the worst attack on the capital since February 2004 , when a suicide bombing killed at least 41 people on a metro train . There have been no terrorist attacks in Moscow since August 2004 , when a suicide bomber blew herself up outside a subway station , killing 10 people . As in February 2004 , on Monday women suicide bombers set off their homemade bombs strapped to their bodies when they were inside trains . In 2004 , the blast occurred when the train was travelling in a tunnel , which explains why it caused more casualties than the current two blasts that ripped through trains parked at stations . Eye-witnesses said that surprisingly there was little panic among passengers and this helped avoid more casualties as thousands of people were evacuated outside . Both metro stations bombed on Monday Lubyanka and Park Kultury are busy interchange stations and are packed during rush hour . They are situated in the city centre and the blasts not only halted train service on several lines , but also paralysed all traffic above as police sealed off streets to give free passage to dozens of ambulances that rushed wounded passengers to hospital . Even as Russian authorities strengthened security and installed closed circuit TV on all stations and in trains , officials conceded it was impossible to provide 100 per cent protection to the underground transport system . Experts said it was not feasible to set up airport-style screening that could detect explosives and metal objects as this would disrupt subway traffic . However , thanks to CCTV police could promptly identify the two suicide bombers and their three accomplices and launch a manhunt for them . Interestingly , none of the metro blasts caused much damage to the subway stations themselves . On Monday , both bombed stations reopened for traffic in the afternoon . The Moscow Metro has 298.8 km of route length , 12 lines and 180 stations ; on a normal weekday it carries about 8 million passengers .

Train services on the Midnapur-Adra section of South Eastern Railway were affected by the blast and normalcy could be restored only at 9-15 a.m. .

Though the Special Court was established at the Bani Park Courts Complex here in December last year and a presiding officer of the rank of District and Sessions Judge was appointed to it , it was not functioning for want of infrastructure and staff . Only recently , the Rajasthan High Court has ordered transfer of case files to it with the first hearing scheduled for April 10 . The Supreme Court had on February 22 issued notices to several States , including Rajasthan , asking them about the progress of special courts for speedy trial of terror cases . The notices were issued on a petition moved by nine accused in blasts cases across the country lodged in the Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat . The matter has been pending in the court of the Additional District Judge ( Fast Track ) No. 1 , where the trial in a related case of 13 persons from Kota , Baran and Jodhpur facing charges of involvement in the conspiracy for blasts and taking part in the activities of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India is in progress .

This material does not provide any direct evidence of involvement of the accused in the crime , he said . The ATS has neither recovered anything substantial from the accused nor provided concrete evidence to prove that they came to Jaipur on May 13 , 2008 , to carry out the blasts . The 72 witnesses who will depose and will be cross-examined include persons such as shopkeepers of the Walled City , policemen , owners of cycle stores , medical jurists , relatives of the deceased and the injured .

Rajasthan ATS has reached up to them . They have identified the persons involved . ATS has collected some important clues , Mr. Dhariwal said . However , one lost link in the whole case appears to be Sunil Joshi , who was an RSS pracharak in Madhya Pradesh 's Mhow area with whom Devendra Gupta , the first suspect arrested in the Ajmer Dargah case , was associated . Joshi , a resident of LOC_Event , was killed in LOC_Event in December 2007 . The call details of Gupta indicate that both were in touch .

Gupta , who operated in the name of Ramesh Kumar at some places , procured SIM cards under false identities from LOC_Event , LOC_Event and Chittaranjan . The SIM used in the bomb which went off at Ajmer Dargah was procured by him in name of Babulal Yadav . Though the RSS leadership in New Delhi vehemently denied involvement of RSS functionaries in the Ajmer blast , Mr.Dhariwal was equally emphatic .

AFP OPEN Over 60 people were killed and nearly 110 injured in a suicide bomb attack on the office of the assistant political agent of the Mohmand tribal agency bordering Afghanistan 's Kunar province on Friday morning just as locals were gathering there for a scheduled meeting with the official . The bomber came on a motorcycle and blew himself up at the government office in Yakka Ghund tehsil which was particularly crowded because both the assistant political agent and the tehsildar were present for disposal of cases . The blast brought down several buildings in the vicinity and people were trapped in the rubble till late in the day resulting in a mounting death toll as the clock ticked . There were reports that the blast damaged a prison facilitating the escape of a number of prisoners . Mohmand is one of the seven tribal agencies of Pakistan that together make up the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) which is often dubbed the most dangerous place in the world '' because the Taliban/Al-Qaeda is believed to have taken refuge there after being pushed out of Afghanistan . It is the most heavily populated of the seven agencies and had witnessed large-scale displacement in 2008 when fighting flared up between the Army and the militants . The Internally Displaced Persons began returning only this April and this blast has again raised questions on the military 's claims of having made Mohmand militant-free . Condemning the blast , Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said such reprehensible acts only strengthen our resolve '' to ensure that terrorism is never allowed to succeed in its nefarious designs . In a statement , the U. S. Embassy in Pakistan said such brutal acts clearly demonstrated the terrorists ' complete disregard for human life . The Peshawar-based Tribal NGOs Consortium used the attention that the blast brought to Mohmand to focus on the plight of the people of FATA who continue to live outside the ambit of the law of the land and human rights standards that are an accepted norm elsewhere . FATA and its people have been suffering for the last many years and especially after 2001 when extremism and terrorism took the area into its grip and forced the people to either migrate to comparatively safer areas of the province or live as per the terms and conditions of the militants and military alike .

Ginger plantation It is at a ginger plantation at Hosathotha that Mr. Maudany is supposed to have met T. Nazir , the prime accused in the blasts in which a woman was killed and 20 persons were injured . The team also wants to investigate whether the plantation at Hosathotha was being used as a covert meeting place for hatching conspiracies . Mr. Maudany and the police team are expected to be back in Bangalore on Monday . Statements recorded Meanwhile , the city police have recorded the statement of 255 witnesses in connection with the serial blasts . Since more than a dozen accused in the blasts are PDP members , the finger of suspicion pointed at Mr. Maudany , a senior police official on condition of anonymity told The Hindu . Sources said the two-day interrogation of Mr. Maudany had so far not revealed anything substantial . Apart from admitting to having spoken to Nazir from Kerala , Mr. Maudany had denied that either he or his wife , Soofiya , had any role in the serial blasts . The sources said they would take a decision on seeking an extension of Mr. Maudany 's remand after he returned from Kodagu .

OPEN A bomb blast ripped through a bus at LOC_Event near LOC_Event in LOC_Event 's LOC_Event province on Saturday , killing at least six persons and injuring 20 others . An explosive device was planted under a seat at the rear of the bus , the police said . PTI OPEN More than 24 hours after a low-intensity explosive device went off near a car parked on a service lane outside the Delhi High Court , the Delhi Police had no clue to the identity of the group behind the blast or the motive . We are yet to conclusively identify the group behind the explosion . The matter is under investigation , Joint Commissioner of Police ( Special Cell ) R.S. Krishnia said on Thursday . Also , it is difficult to comment on the composition and nature of the bomb as we are awaiting the Central Forensic Science Laboratory 's report . The explosives kept in a case resembling a toilet-kit bag went off near Gate No. 7 . A battery-like object , wires and some nails were also found on the site by forensic experts . A white powder , suspected to be ammonium nitrate , was used . Though senior police officers remained tight-lipped about the investigation , sources said they were working on several theories . According to one theory , the bomb was meant to be planted in the court , but the culprit could not gain entry to the premises and abandoned the bag in the parking lot . Another is that the crude bomb was not meant to cause any major damage , and could be the handiwork of some disgruntled elements . Some eyewitnesses are reported to have told the police that they had seen a motorcyclist coming from the direction of the parked car minutes before the explosion . We have been trying to get the description of the motorcyclist the culprits could have come on foot or in a car . It seems the target has been chosen carefully as there are no closed-circuit television cameras there , a senior police officer said . OPEN Five persons were arrested in connection with the bomb blasts at a building at LOC_Event in the city last month . - Page 3 OPEN Nearly a year after taking up the probe into the Samjhauta Express blasts case , the National Investigation Agency on Monday filed a charge sheet in the Special Court , NIA , at Panchkula , Haryana , against five accused persons . The accused are Naba Kumar Sarkar alias Swami Asimanand , Sunil Joshi ( now dead ) , Lokesh Sharma , Sandeep Dange and Ramchandra Kalasangra alias Ramji . The blasts on the Attari Express , also known as the Samjhauta Express , near LOC_Event , on February 18 , 2007 , and the consequent fire in the coaches killed 68 passengers and injured 12 others . Not only Indian civilians and government officials , but also a large number of Pakistani nationals were killed and injured . A bi-weekly train that runs on Wednesdays and Sundays between Delhi and Attari in India and Lahore in Pakistan , the Samjhauta Express has played a key role in improving people-to-people contacts . The initial investigation was carried out by the Railway Police and the Haryana Police ; on July 26 last year , the Union Home Ministry handed over the probe to the NIA , which registered the case on July 29 . NIA sleuths fanned out to several parts of the country to unravel the conspiracy . Numerous witnesses and suspects were examined and material evidence was collected . The investigation , conducted over almost one year , established that the entire conspiracy was hatched between 2005 and 2007 by Swami Asimanand , Sunil Joshi and his associates such as Ramji , Sandeep Dange , Lokesh Sharma and others at different places in Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh and other States . Investigation further brought out that Swami Asimanand was quite upset with the Jehadi/terrorist attacks on temples Akshardham ( Gujarat ) , Raghunath Mandir ( Jammu ) and Sankat Mochan Mandir ( Varanasi ) . He used to give vent ' to his feelings while -LSB- holding -RSB- discussions with Sunil Joshi and his associates . Over a period of time , they developed a deep -LSB- sense -RSB- of vengeance for not only the Jehadi terrorists , but unfortunately against an entire minority community as such , the charge sheet said . Bomb for bomb theory As a result , Swami Asimanand propounded abomb ka badla bomb -LSB- bomb for bomb -RSB- theory . The Samjhauta Express was particularly chosen , as most of its passengers are Pakistani citizens . He not only provided financial and logistical support to the terror group which executed this dastardly act but also played a vital role in instigating and motivating his associates to undertake this terrorist act , it said . Sandeep Dange , Ramji , Lokesh Sharma and others , acting under the leadership of Sunil Joshi , were instrumental in procuring the raw materials for building Improvised Explosive Devices and getting them fabricated and planted .

OPEN Mortar bombs , projectiles , grenades , rockets , detonators , artillery shells were unheard of in Shekowal and Kalewal village , until Indian Army 's biggest operation to dispose off scrap ammunitions began there in November . Over 30 kms from here , 738 residents and 2,500 animals of the villages are evacuated each day by the police to the nearby Gurdwara and other safe places so that the Army can transport , segregate and then dispose of over 17,000 pieces of ammunitions of unknown origin that made their way to the centre of the industrial capital of Punjab . Steel and other metal re-rolling units in Punjab had imported the scrap at throwaway prices between 1999 and 2004 . They had not specified the nature of the consignment and only mentioning scrap while taking permission for the imports . It was only during inspections by Customs that their hazardous nature was discovered at a dry port in the industrial hub of Ludhiana in 2004 but it took nearly six years to start the process of disposing it off . Bomb disposal is always high risk so we take extra precautions to ensure the safety of the men handling the ammunition , the villagers and even the cattle . We execute six to eight blasts every day and the project should be complete in two months . The sheer scale of the operation has given us a chance to train our team , said Lt. Col. Vinod Bhat , commanding officer of the 202 Bomb Disposal Unit ( BDU ) , about the Operation . The operation has been named Saiyam ' ( patience ) . We have been trained but each time a bomb is picked or placed there is considerable risk involved , that is why the remote controlled vehicles , telescopic handling machines , bomb suits etc are used , if proper precautions are taken there is little fear left , said a jawan in a bomb suit as he picked a rusted piece of metal and carefully placed it on a padded crane . The scrap was intended to be recycled for the steel industry and had the explosives gone off while melting the scrap , consequences would have been catastrophic . The ammunitions , weighing over 50 tonnes , was imported into the country in the garb of metal scrap to be recycled into steel . It was stored in five containers , four of which were 20 feet long and one was 40 feet in length at the dry port which is located inside a populated area in Ludhiana . Operation Saiyam will cost about Rs . 13.5 million and the authorities have levied this penalty on the eight private individuals who imported the scrap . Till now , Army officers have conducted over 60 blasts and destroyed over 1400 pieces . It is only through visual inspection that we saying that there are about 17,000 pieces of ammunitions . We have not counted them physically . The number can go up when we take actual stock of the situation in the coming days , he said . This is a very tedious process and consumes a long time . Our officers can not rush things and they have to be very patient . Therefore , we keep rotating our officers on different jobs so that monotony does not set in , Lt. Col. Bhat pointed out . The villagers have been told to keep away from their fields between 7 am and 5 pm till the operation is completed . Army aims to destroy the large calibre ammunition first so that the villages can be rehabilitates as soon as possible , the cooperation of the villagers is very important , we have 12 police posts to ensure that once the blasts begin , there is no one around the area and until we are left with very small calibre ammunitions , we wo n't take any risk , Lt Col Bhatt said adding the most dangerous are the hand grenades as most of them are without their pins .

At the same time , he urged the Election Commission to provide adequate security to the people during the Assembly elections , in the wake of the blast . After the declaration of model code of conduct , the Election Commission will have a major role in issues such as security , he said .

While state Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee refused to divulge details about the outfit whom the investigation team was suspecting or if the explosion had any link with any agency from Pakistan , a report in The Telegraph has raised questions about whether the the alleged terror outfit had suspected links to Pakistan-based al Qaeda . According to the news report , one of the pamphlets featured the name of Ayman al-Zawahiri , the al Qaeda leader who had last month announced the formation of the terror outfit 's branch in the Indian subcontinent , wading into a region ripe with fierce anti-western ideology and full of young unemployed men ready to take up guns and fight . `` In the pamphlets , we found words and phrases like ` mujahid ' and ` salaam to our brothers in Chechnya ' . We also found the name of Zawahiri ( the Qaeda leader ) in some pamphlets , '' a police officer told The Telegraph . Addressing a press conference , state Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee said that the state was also in touch with central agencies including NIA in this regard . `` A large number of chemicals have been used in bomb-making and much of these have been seized . Recovery has also been made of a large quantity of literature both printed as well as downloaded from the internet which basically relate to ways and means of making bombs and explosive devices , '' Banerjee said . Ruling out allegations of the state not cooperating with central agencies , he said a section of media had reported that NIA had said that state agencies were not cooperating with them . `` I would like to deny this . Senior officials of both sides are in touch , it is a far serious matter between the Centre and the state , '' he said . `` Certain media reports said that posters relating to al Qaeda were found . No such posters have been found so far . Investigation is on , '' the Home Secretary said . He , however , denied that RDX was found at the blast site as reported in a section of media . `` A Central Forensic Science Laboratory ( CFSL ) team led by assistant director has since visited the place of occurrence on the very next day and they have inspected the site , '' he said . `` CID has taken over the investigation and the DGP has since formed a composite task force with top officials from CID , district police , IB and Kolkata Police under the leadership of DIG CID , '' Banerjee said . `` The accused persons before the police arrived tried to destroy some materials by burning but a large number of incriminating documents , telephones etc have been recovered , '' he said . `` Investigation is continuing to see whether it has further ramification or not , '' he added . Banerjee said two persons have been arrested so far in connection with the case . These are Gulsana Bibi , wife of Shakil and Alima Bibi , wife of Abdul Halim .

Denying its involvement in the explosion on the tracks on the LOC_Event in LOC_Event district , the outfit also questioned the credibility of the administrations intelligence network . It is common knowledge that the area is dominated by the BLT . It is BLTs handiwork but the Kokrajhar administration put the blame on us , NDFBs self-styled captain B. Sudem claimed in a press note . . . The outfits allegation is likely to embarrass the BLT , also a signatory to the new Bodo pact that envisages a new administrative set-up with the creation of the proposed Bodoland Territorial Council . The Centre has pledged to approve the BTC Bill by August if required , by convening a special session of Parliament . . . Though there was no casualty in the blast triggered during heavy showers , 10 bogies of a goods train were derailed between Kakiragram and Sechapani . Train services were restored yesterday . . . The outfit also sought a judicial inquiry into the June 20 encounter deaths in Gossaigaon sub-division . . . The outfit refuted the armys claim that it had gunned down two of its activists Komal Basumatary and Mohesh Mochahary at LOC_Event under Gossaigaon sub-division on Friday in an encounter and seized arms from them . Sudem alleged that the victims were farmers killed by the Army personnel from Sapkhata while they were working in their field . Two near-simultaneous car bombs rocked the Iraqi capital on Sunday , killing at least 29 people and wounding 111 in the city 's deadliest day in a month . The violence was the worst to hit Iraq since U.S. troops declared an official end to combat operations on September 1 , and comes with no new government yet formed since a March general election . The twin blasts struck near the Aden junction in north Baghdad and in the residential district of Mansur in the west of the capital at around 10:10 a.m. ( 0710 GMT ) , said AFP journalists and security officials . An Interior Ministry official put the death toll at 29 19 in Aden and 10 in Mansur . It was a minibus the driver stopped and told people nearby that he was going to go see a doctor , said a witness to the Aden bombing . A few minutes later , it exploded . An AFP journalist at the scene said the blast , against a National Security department office building , left a crater three metres in diameter and that security forces had cordoned off the area .

AFP OPEN The Organisation for Protection of Democratic Rights ( OPDR ) has strongly condemned the bomb blast at the hospital of Krishna Murthy at Sompeta in Srikakulam district on Wednesday and demanded a probe into the incident . In a statement , OPDR State general secretary C. Bhaskar Rao said that the bomb blast could be the handiwork of the police or the management of the power plant proposed at Sompeta as Dr. Krishna Murthy had been relentlessly campaigning against the project . He said the State government should immediately order a probe to find out the people who planted the bomb and bring them to book at the earliest . OPEN A person who was injured in the police lathicharge on protesters at NCC thermal power plant site at Sompeta on July 14 succumbed on Wednesday , while a crude bomb mysteriously exploded in Mahalakshmi Hospital owned by Y. Krishnamurthy , president of the Paryavarana Parirakshana Sangham ( PPS ) . Both the incidents brought the situation to a boil once again in Sompeta and a bandh is being called by the PPS that spearheaded the agitation against the power plant . Dr. Krishnamurthy and another leader of PPS Bena Dhilli Rao suspected the hand of local Congress leader , P. V. Ramana and his supporters in the bomb blast . No one was injured in the explosion but the front elevation of the hospital and furniture was damaged in the second floor where the bomb was planted . Eye witnesses said the blast took place at 2.15 p.m. when Dr. Krishnamurthy was treating patients on the ground floor . Patients and medical staff ran out of the hospital . The 60-year-old Bendalam Krishnamurthy who was injured in the lathicharge was undergoing treatment at a hospital all this while and was discharged only a week ago . This pushes the death toll to three as two persons were killed in police firing on July 14 . The PPS leaders submitted a representation to the District Superintendent of Police Sanjay Kumar Jain urging him to conduct a thorough inquiry and to take stern action against those involved . People with the vested interests and supporters of power plant are trying to eliminate us physically . These incidents will not deter us and we will continue to fight against the power plant , said Mr. Dhilli Rao . Mr. Jain said experts from the forensic department will inquire into the incident . PPS leaders suspected one person called Ramana . We will conduct a thorough inquiry and take the inputs from the forensic department also , he told The Hindu .

The attacks took place despite security being strengthened as always for this procession . Lahore Commissioner Khusro Pervez told reporters that this was a very well-planned and coordinated attack as the suicide bomber which was the deadliest of the three attacks managed to penetrate the security cordon in the melee of the initial blasts .

OPEN Eight youths were arrested by the Bada Bazar police in the city in connection with a case of bomb attack . The youths were involved in blasting of crude bombs in Panigrahypentha area of the city in which one Narayan Behera was seriously injured . Past rivalry had led to the attack , police sources said . OPEN After a lull , political violence has surfaced again in the rural areas , particularly in the politically sensitive Nadapuram police station limits , of the district . At least two incidents were reported early on Saturday . A bomb was thrown at the house of Kuttiyil Aziz at Kadimeri . There was no casualty . However , the blast damaged a portion of the house . The bomb disposal squad also recovered an unexploded bomb from the terrace of the building , the police said .

The windscreen of a stationary private bus was shattered . The police have recovered an unexploded pipe bomb from the site . A posse of personnel were camping in the area , the police said . CPI ( M ) observes hartal in Ayancherry panchayat Police personnel deployed in violence-hit areas OPEN : The Additional Director General of Police ( Law and Order ) , S. George , visited the causeway in LOC_Event near LOC_Event , where a pipe bomb was recovered , on Saturday . He was accompanied by SIT Deputy Inspector General of Police , John Nicholson , SP B. Vijayakumari and Deputy Inspector General of Police ( Dindigul Range ) Sanjay Mathur . Personnel of several wings of the State police , including the Q ' branch , the Special Intelligence Unit , Bomb Detection and Disposal squad ( BDDS ) from Chennai and Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department and forensic experts are camping here , trying to assimilate the bits and pieces of information available with them to arrive at the motive and the people behind the criminal act . Earlier , Mr. George had a long discussion with the Commissioner , P. Kannappan , Superintendent of Police Asra Garg and other police officials here . A BDDS official said that it was for the first time he came across such a huge quantity of around eight kg of Power Gel 90 explosive planted in an act of sabotage in the State . We have come across the explosives only in the range of one to two kg . But this is huge , he added . The explosive , packed in a PVC pipe , was placed in one of the two bed-level spans under the causeway at LOC_Event on the LOC_Event . Since the span was narrow , the suspects connected the explosive-packed ( four-foot-long ) PVC pipe with an empty pipe ( of an identical length ) to place it right in the middle of the carriage way , a police source said . The police officials were stunned by the choice of place of the saboteurs . The bomb was planted on the downstream of the causeway . There were lot of bushes on the upstream side . Probably , they avoided it because the bush that would have provided them a good hiding spot would have also hidden the sight of the road and movement of vehicles , an officer said . While the bomb was placed on the farther side of the causeway , the trigger was placed closer to the entry to the causeway . It was placed on the farther side since the conspirators ' plan was to get maximum time and to ensure that the target vehicle was in the middle of the causeway . Besides being closer to the entry ( of the causeway with the trigger ) would help them sight the target vehicle at the earliest , the officer said . The 12-volt battery connected to some 80-metre-long wire for triggering the blast was placed inside a polythene bag to ensure that the battery was not affected by the wet condition . The police personnel were seen collecting the worn-out pieces of clothes that were used to conceal the wire that was laid on the river bed . The battery was placed amidst wild growth of reeds , which would have given a perfect cover for the saboteur and also allowed him to escape from the scene , after blasting , without being noticed by the people on the road , the officer said . Earlier , Mr. George inspected the Tirumangalam taluk police station , where the remnants of the bomb , the white PVC pipes , the green wire and the brand new battery were kept , police said . The Tirumangalam taluk police had filed a case under Section 307 of Indian Penal Code ( Attempt to murder ) and Sections 4 and 5 of Explosive Substances Act . Meanwhile , the Madurai Rural police , in a statement , said that route bandobust was provided for the convoy of Mr. Advani , police pickets were posted in sensitive areas to collect intelligence , besides checking of route by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad . Based on a specific information received by the Tirumangalam taluk police Sub-Inspector , Kannan , on a suspected object , the police , including the SP , rushed to the spot . It was found to be a pipe-bomb ' , which was removed safely and defused by the BDDS team . The statement added that the police team has come across various objects at the scene of crime which gave important clues for further investigation . OPEN The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has arrested a youth from Jammu and Kashmir over suspected involvement in the conspiracy behind the recent bomb blast at the Delhi High Court . Wasim Akram Malik was on Friday produced in a special court here , which remanded him in NIA custody for 14 days , during which he would also be confronted with co-accused Amir Abbas Dev . The arrest comes exactly a month after the September 7 blast . The elder son of a worker at a hydel project in Kishtwar , Wasim went to Bangladesh about five years ago for medical studies at a Dhaka institute . Preliminary enquiries suggested that Wasim was in Jammu on September 7 when the blast took place . Suspecting his involvement , the NIA contacted his father seeking his cooperation in the probe and sought his presence for questioning . At his father 's instance , Wasim returned to India and was handed over to the NIA at the Delhi airport . According to sources , the NIA is yet to establish Wasim 's exact role in the conspiracy . He would be probed for any links with the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami ( HuJI ) or any other outfit . Even as the NIA remained tight-lipped about the timing and place of Wasim 's arrest , besides his affiliation to any terror outfit , sources said the agency received information about him from one Azhar Ali , an alleged HM recruiter presently lodged in Jammu 's Kotbalwal Jail . According to sources , NIA officials had recently quizzed Azhar and found that Wasim 's brother Junaid had been initiated into terrorism . Junaid allegedly disappeared a year ago and his family has lodged a missing person report . Intelligence agencies suspect that Junaid has been operating from the Kashmir Valley . In a related development , the special court sent Amir Abbas Dev to seven days in NIA 's custody and ordered that the third accused in the case be produced before a Juvenile Justice Board . The two were arrested in Kishtwar for their alleged complicity in sending an email on behalf of the HuJI , claiming responsibility for the blast . OPEN A landmine was discovered at LOC_Event in LOC_Event district in the course of joint security operations against the Maoists on Friday . The development came just one day ahead of a Trinamool Congress rally to be addressed by Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari where he is expected to speak out against Left-Wing extremist activity in the region . A landmine was discovered near LOC_Event village . Experts from the Bomb Disposal Squad immediately neutralised it by blasting it , Jhargram Superintendent of Police Gaurav Sharma told The Hindu over telephone . Less than a kilometre away , some landmines had been detected and diffused by the police on Thursday . These landmines were recovered just about seven to eight kilometres away from the site where the Trinamool Congress rally is to be held , Mr. Sharma said . He added that elaborate security arrangements have been put in place ahead of Saturday 's rally . Earlier this month also , suspected Maoists opened fire at a procession of the anti-Maoist political outfit , Jana Jagaran Manch , which is backed by the Trinamool Congress in Paschim Medinipur district on November 6 . The activists of the Jana Jagaran Manch were out on motorcycles asking people to attend the rally . OPEN : The NIA Special Court on Wednesday remanded in judicial custody Danish Riyaz , 34th accused in a case relating to organising a secret training camp for activists of the Students Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) at Wagamon in Idukki district in 2007 . He was brought from Gujarat where he was lodged in jail in connection with a bomb blast case . A charge sheet against 30 activists of the SIMI had already been filed before the court . The NIA 's case was that in November 2007 , the activists of the proscribed organisation had entered into a criminal conspiracy in Madhya Pradesh and other places to conduct training camps for their cadres . They had organised camps in Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat from December 10 , 2007 to December 12 besides arranging a secret training camp at Wagamon in December . OPEN The recent seizure of a pipe bomb ' on the scheduled route of the Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. K. Advani 's yatra near LOC_Event in LOC_Event district has come as a wake-up call for the officials of the Revenue and Police departments and the Directorate of Mines and Minerals in Kanyakumari district to streamline the operation of stone quarries and the distribution of explosive substances to blast rocks . 50 unauthorised quarries There are 43 approved stone quarries and more than 50 unauthorised quarries functioning in the district . Boring of rock is done manually as blasting results in cracks in nearby buildings . The quarry dust emanating from the rubble also poses a health hazard . Still , explosives are used to blast rocks in the district . There have also been instances of illegal possession of explosive materials such as detonators , gelatine sticks , cut wires and batteries . Recently , explosive materials were planted at the residence of a teacher at LOC_Event , which created a suspicion that it could be related to the attempt to blast Mr. Advani 's convoy . Later , it turned out to be a conspiracy hatched by the teacher against her spouse . The free and easy availability of explosive materials in the district is a cause for concern among officials . They are worried about the unchecked quarrying activity . High demand Explosives are in demand in illegal quarrying sites , which also use machinery . Workers fall victims to accidents in these quarries , officials allege . There have been reports of loss of limbs in quarries . Shortage of staff The official machinery , which regulates and monitors the use of explosives , is plagued with shortage of staff and vehicles . Even inspection of the quarry has to be done in a vehicle provided by the lessee . The illegal means of procuring and using explosives could be curbed by providing adequate staff to the police and revenue officials as also those attached to the office of the Assistant Director ( Mines and Minerals ) . An intensified vigil will also prevent inter-State movement of explosive materials . Easy availability of explosive materials is a cause for concern , writes P.S. Suresh Kumar OPEN LOC_Event was shaken on Thursday by a string of lethal bombings that not only killed at least 57 persons and wounded 180 , but also heightened sectarian tensions that were already on edge following the withdrawal of American forces . At least 12 blasts , likely coordinated , hit several neighbourhoods , leaving behind a trail of death and destruction . For several hours after the bombings , plumes of grey smoke swirled into the sky from the sites of the carnage . The surge in violence on Thursday was seen by many as retaliation against the government which has issued an arrest warrant against Tariq-al Hashimi , Vice-President and an established Sunni leader . The Interior Ministry has levelled terrorism charges against Mr. Hashimi , based on statements that he personally ordered assassinations of his opponents , by his bodyguards . The embattled Vice-President , currently residing in the semi-autonomous area governed by the Kurdistan Regional Movement ( KRG ) , has said he was ready to stand trial in the Kurdish areas , but has declined to participate in a judicial process run in LOC_Event . The controversy is already undermining political stability in Iraq , where the perception of a power vacuum is rife , following the U.S. exit , after nearly nine inglorious years of occupation . Iraq 's slide into chaos or the establishment of a new model of governance outside the existing framework that the Americans had micro-managed , would rob the Obama-administration of its claims of recording double-success in Iraq of establishing democracy and withdrawing U.S. forces . The Iraqiya coalition holding 82 seats , of which Mr. Hashimi 's Renewal List is a part has already declared that it was suspending its participation in the 325-member Parliament . The Iraqi National List led by the former Prime Minister , Iyad Allawi , and the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue led by Saleh al-Mutlaq , are also part of this coalition which has solid Sunni support . The bloc has accused Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki of monopolising all decision-making . In response , Mr. Maliki on Wednesday warned that in case Iraqiya did not participate , he would appoint new Ministers . This has mounted further stress on the Iraq 's fragile system of governance , which in the past has shown that it has an inbuilt capacity to fray along its several religious , sectarian and ethnic fault-lines . The serial blasts on Thursday began in the early hours when Iraqis were heading for work and shops were about to open . The LOC_Event neighbourhood was one of the worst hit by the multiple blasts , in which car bombs and improvised explosives were used with deadly effect . OPEN Bomb attacks on churches during Christmas services , including one outside the capital LOC_Event , have killed at least 28 people in LOC_Event amid spiralling violence claimed by an Islamist group . The Islamist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for theAbuja blast and violence in recent days that has stoked fear and anger in LOC_Event 's most populous nation . Authorities have been seemingly unable to stop the attacks despite heavy-handed military crackdowns and claims of arrests of Boko Haram members . The area around the scene of the blast outside Abuja , which killed at least 27 , degenerated into chaos , with angry youths starting fires and threatening to attack a n A bomb blast later hit outside an evangelical church hundreds of km away in the central city of LOC_Event , killing a policeman , according to a spokesman for the governor . Another explosion targeted a church in the northeastern area of LOC_Event on Christmas Eve , but no one was reported killed , while two other blasts hit the northeastern city of LOC_Event on Christmas Day , including a suspected suicide bombing . AFP OPEN Another Indian Mujahideen suspect has been arrested by Delhi Police Special Cell officers in Purnea ( Bihar ) . With this , seven arrests have been made so far and the police are on the lookout for half-a-dozen more . The accused has been identified as Aftab . The police suspect his involvement in the twin blasts outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore . He will be brought to Delhi on transit remand for further investigations , said a police officer on Tuesday . The arrest follows purported revelations by the six alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorists , including a Pakistani national , who were arrested a few days ago in connection with Delhi 's Jama Masjid shooting-cum-blast , Pune 's German Bakery and Chinnaswamy Stadium blasts last year . According to the police , some of the accused were directly involved in these cases and the others in the conspiracy and terror activities . They were part of a module set up by a suspected Indian Mujahideen operative , Shahrukh , on whom the police have declared a reward of Rs .15 lakh . Shahrukh , said to be an expert at assembling improvised explosive devices , is suspected to have configured the bombs used in the three cases . His job was also to procure explosives , which he supplied in the 2008 Delhi serial blasts . Since 2009 he has been overseeing the outfit 's activities across the country . Of those arrested so far , Qateel Siddiqi was close to Shahrukh . We suspect that Qateel was directly involved in the Jama Masjid and German Bakery cases , said a police officer , adding that Aftab would be confronted with the other accused once he is brought to the Capital . Sources said that Aftab , who operated under aliases Farooq and Roshan , was nabbed from a village under the Jalalgarh police station by a Special Branch team aided by the Purnea district police following a tip-off from the Intelligence Bureau . Declining to give specific details , Purnea Superintendent of Police Amit Lodha said the operative had sneaked in from neighbouring Nepal into Bihar 's Araria district a few months ago . OPEN A year after an explosion had rocked the LOC_Event in LOC_Event , security agencies are clueless about the module that was used to trigger the bomb blast that left a 2-year-old girl dead and over three dozen injured . Those behind the blast continued to remain a mystery for investigators as did the nature of the explosive material used to trigger the bomb . However , Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) had claimed responsibility for the blast in e-mails sent to media houses and said the incident was in response to demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 . The recent modules busted by the Delhi Police in which six persons allegedly belonging to the IM were arrested have expressed their ignorance about the LOC_Event explosion . Security forces have rounded up many people and jailed terrorists were questioned without any results . There was a move to handover the probe to the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) but it was dropped because of issues between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh Government . - PTI OPEN The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Tuesday announced a reward of Rs . 10 lakh each for information that could lead to the arrest of Sandeep Dange alias Parmanand and Ramchandra Kalsangra alias Ramji alias Vishnu Patel in connection with the Samjhauta Express blast case . It also announced a reward of Rs . 2 lakh for the arrest of Ashok alias Amit alias Prince alias Sunny alias Ashwini alias Ashwini Chauhan , also wanted in connection with the case , a statement from the agency said . In his confession statement before a LOC_Event magistrate last month , Swami Aseemanand named Dange and Kalsangra as being instrumental in carrying out a number of bomb blasts , including the one on the Samjhauta Express . The February 2007 blast led to the death of 68 persons . OPEN A special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act ( MCOCA ) court on Thursday granted permission to the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to reinvestigate the 2006 Malegaon blast case . The agency moved an application before the court in the light of Swami Aseemanand 's confession of his involvement in the Malegaon case , among other terror activities . In light of the disclosures made by Aseemanand before a Delhi court , we filed an application stating that we desire to look into the case and sought permission under section 173 sub clause 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to further investigate it .

Four bombs exploded on September 8 , 2006 in the powerloom township of Malegaon in Nashik district . The blasts claimed 37 lives and injured over a 100 people . The State Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) , who was investigating the case initially , filed a 2,200 page charge sheet on December 22 , 2006 , naming nine accused .

OPEN An eight-year-old girl was killed and 12 people were injured , five seriously , in a bomb blast at LOC_Event in LOC_Event 's LOC_Event district on Tuesday . An unidentified cycle-borne person threw the bomb at a fish shop in the market which exploded killing the girl on the spot , SubDivisional Officer S Z Hasan said . The injured were admitted to Sadar hospital where the condition of five was stated to be critical , he said . OPEN A pair of bombs blasted through security checkpoints ringing the Iraqi holy city of LOC_Event Thursday and killed at least 50 people , many of whom were Shia pilgrims headed to observe yearly religious rituals . Authorities estimated as many as 175 people were injured in the afternoon blasts , at least one of which appeared to be caused by a car bomb . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks . But they bore the hallmark of Al-Qaeda and other Sunni-dominated extremist groups that frequently target Shia pilgrimages in hopes of re-igniting sectarian violence that brought LOC_Event to the brink of civil war just a few years ago . Ali Khamas , a pilgrim from the Shia neighbourhood of Sadr City in Baghdad , said he saw a car speeding toward one of the checkpoints , its driver refusing to stop despite warnings screamed by Iraqi soldiers . He sped up and blew up his car near the checkpoint , said Mr. Khamas . After the explosion , people started to run in all directions , while wounded people on the ground were screaming for help . I saw several dead bodies on the ground . Still , Mr. Khamas said , the pilgrims continued to head to LOC_Event . It will not deter us from continuing our march to the holy shrine ... even if the explosions increase . The bombings were the latest in a three-day barrage of attacks across LOC_Event that have killed more than 100 people since Tuesday . AP OPEN Two car bombs on Monday struck Shia pilgrims in an Iraqi holy city , killing at least 18 people as pilgrims massed for religious rituals marking the end of a 40-day mourning period for the Islamic sect 's most beloved saint . The blasts in LOC_Event were the latest in nearly a week of attacks that have killed at least 159 people . The uptick in violence has shattered a lengthy period of calm and raised anew concerns about the readiness of Iraqi forces to take over their own security ahead of a full withdrawal by the U.S. military . The first attack occurred about 7 a.m. in a parking lot near busloads of pilgrims on the eastern outskirts of LOC_Event , 90 km south of LOC_Event . Police and hospital officials said that six pilgrims were killed and 34 people wounded in that attack . A second bomb was discovered nearby and dismantled , police said . More than four hours later , a second car bomb struck pilgrims on the southern edge , killing at least 12 people , including 10 pilgrims and two soldiers , and wounding 21 . Monday 's attacks followed a triple suicide bombing last week along two highways leading to LOC_Event that killed 56 and wounded at least 180 most of them Shia pilgrims . AP OPEN President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday called terrorism LOC_Event 's top security threat and slammed the chaotic state of security at LOC_Event airport where 35 people died in a suicide bomb attack on Monday . The number of wounded in the bombing climbed to 180 on Tuesday . Of the 110 people admitted to hospital , 32 were in grave condition and three were critical , said health officials . Eight foreigners died in the attack , including nationals of Britain , Germany , Bulgaria , and some former Soviet states . Terrorism remains the main security threat to our state , to LOC_Event , to all our people said Mr. Medvedev in a televised address . The Russian leader blasted the government for allowing security at LOC_Event airport to slip into a state of anarchy and called for officials responsible for transport security to be dismissed or face sanctions for negligence . An unnamed investigator said a man in his 30s is believed to have set off a powerful bomb in the crowded international arrival section of LOC_Event on Monday afternoon . The source denied earlier reports that a black widow was responsible for the blast . Police were also reported to be looking for the bomber 's three accomplices spotted on CCTV footage . A source in security services told the RIA Novosti news agency they had been tipped off about the planned suicide bombing , but failed to prevent it . Another report said the LOC_Event bomber could belong to a group of terrorists who arrived in LOC_Event on New Year eve . A woman member of the group died in an accidental blast in a LOC_Event sports club on December 31 that went largely unnoticed . OPEN A primary school student was seriously injured when a crude bomb blasted near him at LOC_Event village under Raikia police station in LOC_Event district . The injured child was Chandan Pradhan ( 8 ) , a student of class three in the local residential school for tribals and dalits . He accidentally stepped on a crude bomb hidden near a pond of the village , which blasted . He was admitted to the Raikia Community Health Centre ( CHC ) . OPEN A car bomb on Thursday ripped through a funeral tent in a mainly Shia area of LOC_Event , the deadliest in a series of attacks that killed at least 40 people . The blasts were the latest in more than a week of bombings that have killed more than 200 people , raising concerns about an uptick in violence as the U.S. military prepares to withdraw from the country . The violence has mainly targeted the majority Shia community and Iraqi security forces , posing a major challenge to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his fragile coalition government that was seated last month . Suspicion The car that exploded about 2 pm on Thursday had been parked with the vehicles of other mourners , several metres away from the tent , so it would n't raise suspicion , said police . Several other cars were set afire and the force of the blast damaged nearby houses . At least 37 people , including four children and three women , were killed and 78 wounded , according to police and hospital officials . AP OPEN Unidentified miscreants threw county-made bombs at a house at LOC_Event in the limits of Vadakara police station in the district on Friday night . No casualty has been reported . The bombs hit the compound wall of a house belonging to N.P. Kunhammed . The wall developed fissures due to the impact of the blast , the police said . The area had earlier witnessed clashes between activists of the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML ) and the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( CPI-M ) . A case has been registered in connection with the incident . The son of Kunhammed was an accused in the case of attack on a reading home recently , the police said . An all-party meeting comprising leaders of various political parties had called for restoring peace at LOC_Event in the wake of increasing violent incidents in the region . Meanwhile , the police recovered a suspicious object similar to a home-made bomb at Iringanoor in the limits of Nadapuram police station in the district on Saturday . The unexploded bomb was recovered from the stairs of a house located near an Ayurvedic clinic on Edacherry road . The Nadapuram police and the Bomb Detection Squad , who arrived at the house , established that the object was a fake bomb containing clay with jute twines . Some culprits could have had carried out the mischief to create a prank on the occupants of the house , the police said . OPEN Karnataka , on Thursday , opposed granting bail to People 's Democratic Party leader Abdul Nasir Maudany , an accused in the Bangalore serial bomb blasts case , alleging that he masterminded the explosions . Opposing the bail application , Advocate-General Ashok Haranahally submitted in the Karnataka High Court that the accused had links with members of terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ) . It would not be safe to grant bail to such a person who is involved in terror activities as already most witnesses in the case are being threatened , Mr. Haranahally said . The accused appeared to have masterminded the blasts , as he was not only involved in the conspiracy but was also in constant touch with other the accused , some of whom were alleged to be LeT members and was continuously monitoring what was happening , the prosecution argued . It just can not be believed that he was not involved in the conspiracy . He was not only involved in it , he also harboured the accused , Mr. Haranahally contended . B.V. Acharya , counsel for Maudany , submitted that a person should not be made accused in a case on the basis of his past . There are no cases against the ISS ( now-defunct Islamic Sevak Sangh that Maudany had founded ) or the PDP that they were or are indulging in unlawful activities . He can not be accused of an offence on that basis , he submitted . Mr. Acharya further contended that the investigation had not been carried out in a fair manner and it was only a make-believe theory to implicate Maudany . Requesting that Maudany be granted bail , Acharya pleaded he would abide by any condition imposed by the court . Maudany has sought bail on the grounds that there was no prima facie case against him . Justice V. Jagannathan sought certain clarifications on the phone call records between the accused and the other accused and posted the case to Friday for further arguments . PTI OPEN The trial in the LOC_Event twin bomb blasts cases began in camera before a National Investigation Agency special court here on Monday . The court ordered in-camera trial on a request from the NIA prosecutor . Two policemen and a porter were injured in the blasts on March 3 , 2006 . The explosions took place at a garbage dump in the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot and near the moffusil bus stand on LOC_Event within 10 minutes of each other . The charge sheet said some of the accused involved in the 2004 Marad case were denied bail by the Kozhikode district court . They , therefore , hatched a conspiracy and planted bombs in order to retaliate and create communal disharmony between two communities . As many as seven accused are facing trial in the case . One accused had earlier been killed in an encounter with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir while crossing the India-Pakistan boarder for getting arms training in Pakistan . Two others were declared as proclaimed offenders as they went into hiding . The charge sheet said some of these accused were also involved in several anti-national and terror-related cases . Earlier , the cases were investigated by the Kozhikode city police and the Crime Branch CID Kozhikode . Taking into consideration the gravity of the incident and its terror angle , the Central government had directed the NIA to take up the investigation . OPEN Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan has alleged that the bomb blast incident at LOC_Event in LOC_Event district on Saturday exposed the preparations the United Democratic Front ( UDF ) was making to instigate violence during the upcoming Assembly elections . At a press conference here on Sunday , the Chief Minister said five UDF workers were killed and three others severely injured when a bomb accidently went off at a secret bomb-making facility of the front . It shows to what extent the UDF leaders , who are in the dock for indulging in corruption and mafia operations , will go , he said . He noted that the UDF had unleashed violence at Nadapuram during the run-up to the 2001 Assembly elections and followed it up with false propaganda to influence the polls . The UDF had started large-scale bomb production as the State prepared to go for elections , he said . They are doing things to divert the attention of people from the case in which their leader is involved . The UDF is doing this on the initiative of the Indian Union Muslim League , he said . He asked Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy to own up responsibility for the LOC_Event incident ( on behalf of the UDF ) and tender his apologies to the people of the State . He said the police would be strict in dealing the mischief mongers and asked people to be vigilant against the ongoing conspiracy . UDF flayed The bomb explosion clearly shows that the UDF is getting ready to sabotage free and fair verdict in the upcoming Assembly elections , Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan has said . In a statement on Sunday , Mr. Vijayan demanded a police investigation into the explosion and stern action against the forces behind it . The death of five IUML workers in the explosion was a serious political issue . The CPI ( M ) leader said the IUML and UDF were indulging in violence to pin down the Left Democratic Front ( LDF ) . During the last days of the Nayanar government , they had not only launched bomb attacks , but had also spread rumours that an LDF activist had molested a housewife . They were attempting a re-enactment of the same political culture . At least in the light of the bomb explosion in the League stronghold of LOC_Event , the UDF leadership should give up politics of violence , he added . Mr. Vijayan said the kinship between certain extremist organisations that function under the label of minorities and the Muslim League was evident in the bomb manufacturing at Nadapuram . Pinarayi Vijayan seeks strong action Terms the incident a serious political issue OPEN Praveen Mutalik , an absconding accused in the 2008 LOC_Event bomb blast case , was arrested on Monday night from Karnataka by Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad . He was produced before a special MCOCA court which remanded him in police custody till February 14 , sources said . PTI OPEN Nine people , including three children , were killed and 20 injured when a car bomb ripped through a crowded market on the outskirts of LOC_Event on Wednesday morning . The blast took place near a police station and was one in a series of explosions that have rocked the city over the past week . According to the police , the explosion at LOC_Event was triggered by a timer device . Police suspect the target was the police station but the bomber could not get to the building in time due to the traffic congestion . OPEN The Supreme Court 's latest judgment holding that mere membership of a banned organisation does not make a person criminal has come as reprieve for 14 persons languishing in the Central Jail here since their arrest in the aftermath of the May 2008 serial bomb blasts on charges of having links with the outlawed Students ' Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) . All 14 accused have been charged with involvement in unlawful activities without any role in the Jaipur blasts . The Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) of Rajasthan Police claimed that they were rallying support for building a terror network in the State as SIMI members and had attended terror camps organised in the Kota region prior to the blasts . Ironically , none of the 35 witnesses presented so far by the prosecution in the fast track Sessions Court here during the trial supported the ATS theory and the majority have turned hostile . Twenty-five other witnesses are yet to depose and be examined , even as the lawyers of the accused have described the evidence against them as frivolous and concocted . The Supreme Court ruled this past Thursday that mere membership of a banned outfit does not make a person criminal unless he resorts to violence or incites people to violence or creates public disorder by violence or incitement to violence . The Court also cautioned subordinate courts against torture-induced confessions made before the police . Association for Protection of Civil Rights ( APCR ) convener and counsel for two of the accused Paikar Farooq told The Hindu here on Monday that the ATS had not linked the accused with the blasts or charged them with indulging in violence . The case has been slapped merely on the basis of their acquaintance with one Sajid Mansuri , who , the Gujarat Police say , masterminded the Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts , he said . However , the trial court and the Rajasthan High Court have rejected as many as four bail applications by the accused . The accused , arrested from Kota , Baran and Jodhpur in a crackdown after the Jaipur blasts , have been charged under various sections of the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , 1967 , and Sections 153-A ( promoting enmity on ground of religion ) and 120-B ( criminal conspiracy ) of the Indian Penal Code . Except for a list of witnesses provided to the court with the claim that Mansuri had visited the Kota region and addressed meetings which the accused attended , the prosecution has not provided any material as evidence to support its case . Mr. Farooq said while Mansuri had not been made an accused , innocent people picked up in the crackdown were languishing in jail . Delegations of distinguished Muslim citizens from Kota and Baran which met State Home Minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal here several times in the past few months with the demand for withdrawal of the case returned empty-handed with the Minister refusing to intervene in the matter . Mr. Farooq said the Supreme Court ruling would certainly benefit the accused . Those facing trial are elderly physician Ishaq Qureshi , his son and Unani medicine student Taufeeq , Nazakat Hussain , Amanullah , Mohammed Yunus , Nadim Akhtar , Munawwar Hussain ( from Kota ) ; Mohammed Ilyas ( Baran ) and Mohammed Sohail and Azam ( Jodhpur ) . Another young man , Inamur Rehman ( Madhya Pradesh ) was brought here after his arrest at Jabalpur in November 2009 and arraigned as an accused . Three other accused from Kota Mahdi Hassan , Imran and Atiqur Rehman were taken to the Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat while facing charges in connection with the Ahmedabad bombings . The trial in the main case of the Jaipur blasts , in which two of the accused are incarcerated here , is going on in a special court constituted for the purpose . Mr. Farooq pointed out that Justice Manish Bhandari of the Rajasthan High Court had in the first week of December 2010 directed the fast track court to complete the trial within four months . We have raised the issue of the ATS ' failure to prove that any of the arrested men was even a member of SIMI , he said . The lawyer said while one of the accused was so aged and frail that he could not get the membership of a students ' organisation , another was a labourer and had been working with his father fitting tiles in houses since his childhood . The ATS ' claim that such people were SIMI members and they attended training camps is ludicrous . The witnesses presented by the ATS mostly kiosk owners , labourers and daily wage earners retracted their statements made earlier to the police and said in the court that the police had put pressure on them to make the testimony to suit the prosecution . The ATS earlier quoted some of these witnesses as saying that they heard the accused talking about SIMI while sipping tea , said Mr. Farooq . The APCR , which has been closely monitoring the progress of trial in the SIMI case as well as the main case relating to the Jaipur blasts , said the Supreme Court ruling would help innocent people not just in Rajasthan but also in different parts of the country arrested on charges of being members of SIMI even after a countrywide Hindutva terror network has come to light . Accused charged with involvement in unlawful activities without any role in Jaipur blasts Case slapped on basis of acquaintance with alleged mastermind of Ahmedabad , Jaipur blasts OPEN The District and Sessions Court on Wednesday acquitted Muthulakshmi , wife of slain forest brigand Veerappan , social worker Kolathur Mani , Nakkeeran reporter S. Sivasubramaniam and four of Veerappan 's associates in the 1993 LOC_Event bomb blast case owing to lack of evidence . The Special Task Force had booked cases under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities ( Prevention ) Act against Veerappan , Muthulakshmi , Mani , Sivasubramaniam , Savariayappan , Papathi , Bonda Basava and Eranna . Twenty-two police personnel and two forest watchers were killed in the bomb blast . Although Muthulakshmi has been acquitted in the DCF Srinivas murder case , the Ramapura police station attack case , the Ramapura-Meenyam attack case and the Palar bomb blast case , she will continue to be in jail till all the cases against her are disposed of , STF sources said . In the Palar bomb blast case , the Supreme Court awarded death sentence to the prime accused Siman , Gynanendra , Bilavendra and Meesekar Madaiah . Their clemency petition is pending with the President . OPEN A young man who allegedly posing as terrorist to extort Rs .2 crore from a neighbour has been arrested by the Delhi Police Crime Branch . The accused had exploded a low-intensity crude bomb near the victim 's residence to intimidate him . The police received a complaint from an auto-parts supplier alleging that in the early hours of August 13 an incendiary device had exploded near his house . The businessman received threat calls and letters from a person claiming to be member of a terror outfit . He threatened to eliminate the victim 's family members if he did not cough up Rs .2 crore . Based on the complaint , the police registered a case and zeroed in on Parvesh Kumar , 22 , the victim 's neighbour . He was arrested on Tuesday . During interrogation , Parvesh purportedly disclosed that he earlier had cordial relations with the businessman . The victim 's financial status improved with the passage of time , but Parvesh 's remained the same . The businessman had loaned some money to his family and recently asked for repayment . This irked Parvesh and he allegedly decided to extort money from him . The accused configured a crude bomb using inflammable materials used in crackers , planted it on the fuel tank of a mini-truck owned by the businessman and set it afire , which caused a minor blast . Posing as terrorist , he then allegedly threatened the victim for protection money . The accused worked as supervisor in a construction company . He had exploded low-intensity crude bomb near victim 's house to intimidate him Parvesh was irked when the victim asked for repayment of loan OPEN A person was injured when a detonator went off at a shop near LOC_Event area here on Wednesday evening . H.S. Venkatesh , Superintendent of Police , said that the blast took place when shop-owner Jagadish tried to remove copper wires from a damaged electronic gadget . Mr. Jagadish , who was seriously injured in the incident , has been shifted to the General Hospital . Sniffer dogs and bomb disposal squad , which were pressed into service , detected another live detonator inside the gadget that exploded , and was immediately defused , he said . Staff Correspondent OPEN The police are on the look-out for a Santro car that was reportedly spotted near Gate No. 5 of the Delhi High Court shortly before the bomb went off on Wednesday morning . It is learnt that a team conducted searches in Yamuna Vihar in this connection . However , no breakthrough was reported till late in the evening . While statements of the injured persons are being recorded to reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the incident , the police are trying to find its similarities with the May 25 low-intensity blast outside Gate No. 7 . Wednesday connection Both the blasts were carried out on a Wednesday , said to be the Public Interest Litigation day in the High Court . While there is more rush on Wednesdays , the timing was also chosen to ensure that maximum casualty was caused . `` The court proceedings were to commence and a large number of people had queued up to collect their entry passes . It was a well-planned terror attack . They must have conducted reconnaissance in the area before they struck , said a police officer . Police sources said there was some difference in the mixture of explosives used in both the blasts . Ammonium nitrate and some fuel oil were used in the previous case , said another police officer . Searches still on Police teams are still conducting searches at the blast site to gather crucial evidence . They have not yet found remains of all the components used in configuring the bomb . In the wake of the blasts , anti-sabotage checks were carried out in all the Jammu-bound trains following an input . OPEN It was yet another busy weekday morning for scores of lawyers and litigants who had gathered outside Gate No. 5 of the Delhi High Court on Wednesday when a deafening explosion shattered the calm . Wednesday morning was no different . People , mostly litigants , had started gathering outside the court gate around 10 a.m. for entry passes . I was standing just a few feet away from the reception counter guarding the construction material when I was suddenly thrown off by a loud explosion . There was smoke all around and nothing could be seen for the next few minutes . When the smoke dissipated , it was a heart-rending scene with pieces of flesh strewn around and blood spattered everywhere . The injured were writhing in pain and crying for help and those who were lucky to have escaped unhurt could be seen running helter-skelter causing complete chaos , said private security guard Shyam Bihari Lal , who considers himself lucky to have survived to tell the tale . Deafening sound Pradeep , a supervisor at the underground parking site opposite the spot , first mistook it for a cylinder blast at the construction site before he realised that it was a bomb blast . For me , the day had just begun and I was busy giving directions to the labourers when I heard a deafening sound . I first thought it was a cylinder blast . But then I could hear people screaming for help and rushed towards the spot . I saw people piled over each other completely soaked in blood near the counter . Such was the intensity of the blast that pieces of torn clothes and flesh could be seen hanging from trees . The scene was so gory that some of our labourers who helped the injured later complained of uneasiness themselves , said Pradeep . Police quick Within no time , several police vehicles and ambulances arrived at the spot and the injured were removed to hospitals . The response of the police was quick . There were over 30 police vehicles and ambulances outside the court within a few minutes of the blast . The ambulances inside the High Court were also pressed into service and the injured were shifted to hospitals . The labourers at the construction site also reached the spot carrying stretches and helped the rescue teams , said Sunil , who drives the car of a lawyer and was present at the spot . Witness to 2 blasts The intensity of the blast could be gauged from the fact that labourers working in an under-construction underground parking lot also felt the earth tremble . We were a group of 30 labourers working in the underground parking when the blast took place . We were several feet under the ground , but still felt the shivers , said Ghanshyam . High Court lawyer Sugreev Dubey , who was also a witness to the earlier blast at the Delhi High Court in May , said that latest blast was several times more powerful . Completely shaken I was inside the court premises waiting for my client to take an entry pass and was a few steps away from the counter when the bomb exploded . It went off with such a loud sound that I could not hear properly for a few minutes after the blast and was completely shaken . When the blast took place in May earlier , I was having a coffee at the canteen just a few meters away . But it was not half as powerful compared to the explosion today . Later in the day , All-India Congress Committee general-secretary Rahul Gandhi also paid a brief visit to the spot . Pieces of torn clothes and flesh could be seen hanging from trees , says a survivor A lawyer witness to 2 blasts in LOC_Event this year says this is a lot more powerful OPEN The death toll in Wednesday 's Delhi High Court blast has risen to 13 with the death of two more persons at the Ram Manohar Lohia ( RML ) Hospital here on Thursday . Forty-year-old Pramod Kumar Chaurasia , a resident of Nangloi , died of injuries on Thursday morning , while 58-year-old E. Pratran died late in the evening .

Most of the injuries are in the lower part of the body , said a senior RML Hospital official . Experts , if needed Over 75 people were injured in the blast and of them 57 were brought to the Lohia Hospital ; one person has been transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences . The hospital will provide all care and facility to the victims . If needed , experts will be roped in from other cities to treat the victims , he added . Blast victims are also undergoing treatment at the Safdarjung Hospital and some private hospitals . Relatives angry At RML Hospital , angry relatives of the victims who shouted slogans against Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday night maintained that they did not want political leaders visiting the hospital . Political leaders visiting the injured does not mean much , they just create confusion here and delay treatment being provided to the injured . They should , however , be working towards ensuring that the common man does not suffer and is able to live peacefully . We do n't want them in hospitals offering sympathy . We want the government to ensure that proper treatment is provided and that the relatives do n't have a problem at various hospitals , said a relative of a blast victim admitted at the RML Hospital . Emergency unit Meanwhile , the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry has made functional an emergency medical relief unit ( in addition to control rooms functioning at RML and other hospitals ) at Nirman Bhavan to help people seeking information on patients admitted to various hospitals in the wake of bomb blast . The control room can be contacted at numbers 23061302 and 23061469 .

Assistant Commissioner of Police ( Madhurawada ) K. Rajendra Rao said that it emerged from a preliminary inquiry that K. Prasad , a cellphone mechanic , and Arasavilli Vinodh ( 19 ) were making cracker bombs in the house of the former . The explosion occurred when Vinodh was engaged in making bombs . At the time Prasad had gone out on an errand . The bombs made of sulphur and potassium went off , ripping the outer portion of the building . The impact of the explosion was so powerful that Vinodh died on the spot . According to local people , a gas cylinder exploded simultaneously . All the household goods suffered extensive damage . The blast ripped apart wooden furniture and refrigerator , besides causing massive cracks on the walls and sunshades . Lakshmi , living in the neighbourhood , suffered minor injuries and was in a state of shock . The injured were rushed to the King George Hospital where they were given first aid . The LOC_Event outpost police are investigating . OPEN Detection of many cases is delayed owing to shortage of police personnel , inadequate facilities and equipment , increase in number of cases and poor cooperation of people . Sometimes , little carelessness and lack of preparedness among police personnel who inspect the crime spot also affect the investigation process and in a worst case scenario , the police are clueless . The police were in such a condition when they investigated the bomb blast case at a TASMAC shop in LOC_Event recently . Normally , the police had to cordon off the entire area to protect it and stop people from entering the crime spot and to prevent them from destroying evidences . But the police did not do them in the case of the TASMAC incident . Before the arrival of police , local people thronged the area and moved from one corner to another in a fit of tension and anxiety . When the police reached the spot , they could not control the crowd and had a tough time in collecting evidences from the blast site . The area was not cordoned off . The investigation officials as well as members of Bomb Detection and Disposal squads could not get accurate details from the crime spot as the public reportedly destroyed minute evidences inadvertently . Plastic tapes , metal barricades , dividers and other materials worth several lakhs of rupees were given to every police station in Theni district to cordon off crime spot . Many police stations never use them , say police sources . The investigation team might have missed many minute evidences owing to movement of people . Many were in an inebriated state as well . Since the blast site was not cordoned off , people moved about freely , writes K. Raju OPEN A mother and her newborn baby were among six family members killed in a roadside bombing in eastern Afghanistan overnight , police and witnesses said on Sunday . The victims were heading home from the hospital after the mother had given birth when the bomb planted by Taliban insurgents tore through their vehicle in LOC_Event province on the Pakistan border , police said . Five other civilians were killed in two separate roadside bomb blasts in the southern province of Kandahar on Sunday . AFP OPEN The Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak ( Prepak ) has claimed responsibility for the bomb blast on Monday night in Imphal that claimed the life of construction worker A. Kom and injured another seriously . In a statement , the underground organisation said the blast was inadvertent and premature as the bomb was supposed to have exploded elsewhere , and apologised to people . While family members of the deceased have been assured of something meaningful by the government , police and paramilitary personnel have beefed up security measures in and around Imphal . OPEN In a simulated seaborne terrorist attack on a high-value land target , three armed operatives made landfall at an isolated stretch of the shoreline here , foxed the police , and infiltrated the well guarded Technopark campus to plant a bomb there at rush hour on Tuesday . The Indian Navys Joint Operations Centre had launched the 48-hour counter-terrorism exercise code-named Operation Gemini on Monday to test the preparedness of the State and Central agencies to combat seaborne terrorist threats and infiltration bids . The operation involved the Navy , Coast Guard , Indian Air Force , and neighbourhood watch committees comprising shore dwellers and seagoing fishermen . The Navy had earlier informed the State police of an imminent seaborne terrorist threat . The police upped its presence at potential landing points along the States 600-km long coastline and put its resources , including civilian look-outs at sea and near the shore , on alert . The agents , two Navy operatives and one Coast Guard man , arrived off the Varkala coast in a seagoing vessel with a shallow draft , which enabled it to operate in waters close to the shore . The agents hailed a small fishing boat and pleaded the fishermen to drop them ashore urgently under the pretext that one of them was ill .

PTI OPEN Investigations into the LOC_Event car blast case took a new turn on Thursday following the Bangkok police 's assertion that suspected terrorists arrested there had used explosives similar to the one employed in the Delhi incident on Monday . The Delhi police are awaiting a formal report from the CBI 's Central Forensic Science Laboratory on the nature of explosives used in the improvised magnetic device . While the composition of the bomb used in Bangkok has not been made public , police sources here said if it was similar to the one used to target the Israeli official here , the ingredient could be a combination of an explosive and an incendiary material , such as nitro-glycerine , which enhances the impact range . Different types of explosives , like potassium chlorate , can be used in the combination . However , the forensic report on the articles lifted from the blast site would make things clear , said an official . Given that a module of foreign nationals was active in Bangkok , agencies here are screening the data on foreigners who have entered the country in the recent past . The local police have also been instructed to carry out checks in guesthouses and hotels and conduct verifications to gather information primarily on foreign nationals who were staying or had stayed there in the past weeks . The focus of the exercise is to identify those with suspicious movements . Earlier , Delhi Police Commissioner B.K. Gupta said investigations were in the initial stages . It is learnt that the police have solved the mystery behind the recovery of an abandoned red-colour motorcycle in the Lado Sarai area of South Delhi . It is not connected to the blast . We have traced its last owner , who lives in the same locality and had parked the vehicle before he left for Ludhiana . It appears that someone had made a failed attempt to steal the vehicle , said an officer . No concrete leads Stating that no concrete leads had emerged so far from the analysis of the phone calls made around the time of the explosion , the officer said efforts were being made to find out if the module or the assailant had been provided logistics support by any local element . Ruling out any possibility at this stage would hamper the probe , he added . While the police had earlier suggested that the pocket-size bomb used in the attack was a sticky bomb , experts said it was only through proper reconstruction of the configuration with the help of articles recovered from the blast site , besides information on the explosives used in the device , that a decision in this regard could be arrived at . Sticky bomb was an anti-tank grenade first designed and developed in Britain during the World War II . Probe in initial stages : Delhi police chiefAbandoned motorcycle not connected to blast Probe in initial stages : Delhi police chief Abandoned motorcycle not connected to blast OPEN A local court on Friday extended the police custody of Naquee Ahmed Wasi Ahmed Sheikh and Nadeem Ahmed Ashfaq Sheikh , two accused arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) in the LOC_Event triple blasts case last year . Their custody has been extended till February 27 . The ATS officials told the court that they needed their custody for further interrogation as they wanted to take the accused out of Mumbai . They did not disclose to the court where they want to take them , Sharif Sheikh , lawyer of the accused , told The Hindu . Three bombs went off at LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event on July 13 last year . Initially arrested in the LOC_Event blast case , Nadeem and Naquee were booked in the LOC_Event blast case as well a week ago . The ATS has accused Naquee of helping two wanted accused in the blasts for finding accommodation in the city . They charged both Naquee and Nadeem of staying with the absconding accused at the Habib building in the city .

The ATS has arrested four persons in the case till now . OPEN Taking a cue from the Israeli Embassy car blast , a movie vendor allegedly bombed the vehicle of a businessman with a crude explosive device at Pitampura here in a bid to extort Rs .5 crore from him . The police claim to have seized from him a crude bomb and a consignment of potassium sulphide . Loud explosion Pramod Jain was on his way to attend a function along with his family when he heard a loud explosion from the rear end of his car near Lok Vihar in Pitampura on Wednesday . Taking it to be a cracker thrown by some mischievous children , the businessman did not report the matter to the police . The next day , Mr. Jain received a call followed by a text message from an unknown number demanding a ransom of Rs .5 crore . Threatening call The caller threatened to injure him and his members if the demand was not met . Investigations revealed the mobile number used to make the call and send the text message had been procured using forged documents and had been in use since May . The police zeroed in on the user and identified him as Gyanender , an acquaintance of the businessman , who supplied movie DVDs at this residence on rent . Potassium sulphide seized The police then raided Gyanender 's residence and seized potassium sulphide and a crude bomb that explodes on impact . During interrogation , he purportedly disclosed that he had prepared two crude bombs and on Wednesday , tailed the businessman 's car on his motorcycle . Gyanender threw one the bombs at the rear bumper of the vehicle , which caused the blast . Based on the findings , the police have arrested Gyanender and seized the mobile phone used in the commission of crime . Accused threw a crude bomb at rear bumper of vehicleCalled , SMSed victim demanding Rs.5-crore ransom Accused threw a crude bomb at rear bumper of vehicle Called , SMSed victim demanding Rs.5-crore ransom OPEN The delay in reconstruction of the blast in the Israeli Embassy car bombing case is being attributed primarily to the excessive use of water to extinguish the fire in the vehicle triggered by the explosion . Experts believe that it destroyed several crucial pieces of evidence essential for reconstructing the bomb used in the attack . What was the need for using so much water ? Had there been a coordinated response to secure the blast site , it would have been much easier to collect samples , said an expert at Truth Labs , a non-government forensic laboratory . The team of experts collected mostly vehicle parts , like wheel-cups and other bulky articles . Most parts of the explosive device were lost due to excessive use of water and other factors , said the expert . The police had earlier revealed that magnet pieces were found at the spot , which was used to attach the improvised explosive device to the car . It is learnt that the magnet was of a special kind , a flexible one that can attach to even uneven surfaces . Such magnets , resembling PBC sheets , are available in the capital as well , revealed the expert . Magnet pieces were also found attached to the rear portion of the car . While the police are yet to receive the final report from the Central Bureau of Investigation 's Central Forensic Science Laboratory , the expert said a high explosive was used along with some incendiary material to enhance its effect . It ripped through the rear metal portion of the vehicle , creating a fragment effect . The small metal parts acted as fragments , he said . Use of watches as timers in explosive devices is now pass , as even one-minute timer circuits are today readily available in the market which can be used with ease . However , the police are yet to clarify if a timer was used in the device . The fact that splinters were not used in the bomb suggests that it was a specific-target oriented attack . The aim was to target the Israeli embassy vehicle and not passersby . Its impact was localised despite the incident taking place in the open with several vehicles stationed at the traffic junction . Stating that the type of bomb is categorised on the basis of the switch mechanism on which it explodes , the expert said the device could be called a sticky bomb only in common parlance . The glass pieces found at the spot were of the rear windscreen that was shattered by the explosion . It is a misconception that they were part of the device , he said , adding all the materials that could be used to configure such a bomb were locally available . In another development , the police have recorded the statement of Tal Yehoshua Koren , the embassy official and wife of the Israel defence attach who had sustained serious injuries in the explosion . The police teams have been visiting the blast site over and over again to reconstruct the sequence of events . OPEN An explosion in a heap of garbage shattered windowpanes of several flats at LOC_Event of LOC_Event on Thursday . While panicked residents mistook it for a bomb blast , police suspect it to be a cracker explosion . Municipal contract workers set fire to trash which they swept to a corner of an open plot abutting an apartment building -- LOC_Event around noon . As the waste-papers and dry grass burned , there was an explosion . Windowpanes of all the flats of LOC_Event facing the open plot and some apartments in adjacent complexes were shattered . None was injured though . I came rushing as my children study in a school here , Ahmed , a plumber from Rajaram Colony , said . He heaved a sigh of relief after finding that the explosion had nothing to do with the school . But students of the school said they felt like running away from their classes on hearing the massive sound . Owner of the open plot where explosion occurred , Sundeep , said the blast could be due to accidental ignition of some explosive materials left behind by contractors who laid an underground drainage pipeline in the area . I am told detonators or explosive substances abandoned by the contractors may have got mixed in the garbage . Unaware of it , the sweepers set it on fire , he said . LOC_Event Inspector S. Bheem Reddy , however , maintained that all evidence at the spot proved the explosion occurred due to abandoned firecrackers . Will the explosion from leftover firecrackers be so powerful as to shatter windowpanes at a height of 50 feet ? It looks like heavy scrap was lying over the firecrackers which must have created high pressure , the Inspector reasoned out . Sniffer dogs , bomb disposal and CLUES team inspected the spot . OPEN The Special Court for Blast Cases at Karaiyanchavadi , LOC_Event sentenced five persons to life imprisonment in connection with Nagore blast case registered in the year 1995 and acquitted two others who were charge-sheeted in the same case . The CB-CID police had investigated the Nagore blast case in which Ms. Thangam , wife of Hindu Munnani activist Muthukrishnan of Nagore was killed when she opened a parcel bomb on July 3 , 1995 . During investigation , it was revealed that another parcel was also sent to a BJP party functionary at Mayiladuthurai on the same day . However , the parcel was brought back to the post office as the addressee was not in station . The police who later opened the parcel found that it too contained a bomb and proceeded to defuse it .

OPEN An MBBS student of a college at Sylhet in Bangladesh , Wasim Akram Malik , accused of plotting the Delhi High Court blast on September 7 , 2011 , was allegedly inspired by books and texts on the late al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the Taliban 's spiritual leader Mullah Omar he read on the Internet . Wasim had also read a lot about Ayman al-Zawahiri , an Egyptian doctor and current leader of the al-Qaeda . Being a doctor himself , Wasim identified with him and eulogised his contribution towards jihad . Jihad , he believed , was a means of revolution , which , if done with dedication , shall definitely bring about a change in the lives of the Kashmiri population , the National Investigation Agency said in a statement . The agency alleged that Wasim reached Delhi in the end of June 2011 and after reconnaissance of the Delhi High Court area chose to target Gate No : 5 to inflict maximum fatalities in an IED attack . After reaching Kishtwar in July , he contacted three Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants his brother Junaid Akram Malik , Amir Kamal , and Chota Hafiz . He exhorted and instigated them to think big ' and beyond Kishtwar and J&K . ' He fully convinced them about the seriousness and gravity of his plan and his commitment towards jihad , the NIA said . During a meeting in the second week of July , the three Hizb-ul operatives approved Wasim 's plan of a terror strike at the Delhi High Court . Wasim insisted on highlighting the action in the national and international arena and the need for deploying non-Kashmiri looking boys for executing this task in Delhi . The responsibility of arranging non-Kashmiri boys and getting an IED fabricated was taken by Amir Kamal and Chota Hafiz . Wasim admitted that he sent the email to media houses claiming responsibility for the bomb blast . Jihadi project In the third week of July , Wasim directed accused Amir Abbas Dev to look for a confident person with good knowledge of computer and Internet and motivate him for undertaking an important Jihadi ' project . This person was to send the email to media houses . Thereafter , Wasim purportedly left Jammu for Bangladesh via Delhi on July 29 . On September 2 , the three Hizb-ul men allegedly introduced Abu Saifulla and Abu Bilal to Wasim as militants from Pakistan who had been arranged for carrying out the bomb blast . During this meeting , they allegedly planned to explode the IED on September 7 , a Wednesday , as Wednesdays are Public Interest Litigation ( PIL ) days at the High Court and consequently attract more litigants . On September 4 , Wasim and Dev allegedly dropped the two Pakistani militants at a bus stand at Kishtwar . The duo was supposed to proceed to Kud , where Junaid would allegedly hand over the briefcase containing the IED . The next day , Wasim allegedly met Dev again at Kishtwar and passed on the email message . Wasim instructed Dev to tell Abid Hussain Bhawani to keep watching TV news channels on September 7 , and to send the email a few hours after hearing the news about the bomb blast . Abid Hussain Bhwani followed the instructions of Amir Abbas Dev and sent the email as planned earlier , the statement said .

OPEN LOC_Event on Tuesday was rocked by a nationwide string of bombings that killed at least 43 people and put on edge authorities who are set to host next week the Arab summit a symbol of the country 's diplomatic resurgence after years of conflict . An explosion in LOC_Event targeted the Foreign Ministry , where dozens of employees have been working round the clock for the summit . The car blast killed three people outside the Ministry but failed to breach the outer security perimeter of the building . The bombing was a grisly reminder of the attack on the Foreign and Finance ministries in 2009 that killed scores of people . Another attack in the capital 's LOC_Event neighbourhood killed five . LOC_Event Tuesday 's bombings appeared indiscriminate , targeting Shia pilgrims , a Sunni stronghold in Anbar province , civilians and security personnel . They also took place on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the invasion of LOC_Event led by the United States . LOC_Event , a major Shia pilgrim centre , was badly hit when a car bomb exploded at LOC_Event . Thirteen pilgrims , including four from LOC_Event , were killed .

The LOC_Event police have registered a case under the IPC and the Indian Explosive Substances Act . Three persons , including a minor , have been arrested OPEN The LOC_Event Police have received a report from the Central Bureau of Investigation 's Central Forensic Science Laboratory stating that trinitrotoluene ( TNT ) had been used in the improvised magnetic device to trigger the blast in the Israeli Embassy 's car here over two months ago . The detailed report prepared by explosive experts following examination of the samples lifted from the blast site close to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's 7 Race Course Road residence said TNT had been used as an explosive for configuring the device . It also reportedly confirmed that a magnetic strip was used to attach the device to the car in which Tal Yehoshua Koren , an Embassy official and wife of Israel 's defence attach , was going to pick up her children from school on February 13 . TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives by the military and construction companies as it is stable compared to other explosives , reducing the risk of detonation by accident . Earlier the LOC_Event Police had described the device used in the attempted assassination of the Israeli diplomat as a sticky bomb , used for the first time in the country . The police had last month claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of senior journalist Syed Mohammed Ahmad Kazmi , alleging that he was in touch with one of the Iranian suspects involved in the attack . The three Iranian nationals , who visited the country to allegedly conduct reconnaissance and target the Israeli Embassy car , were then identified as Houshang Afshar Irani , Seyed Ali Mahdian and Mohammad Reza Abolghasemi .

According to the Associated Press , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) claimed responsibility for the blast triggered by a teenager . Police said the suicide bomber detonated his bomb-strapped vest as he approached a check post in Khar , the main town of Bajaur . Several of the dead and many among the 40 injured were security personnel , particularly of the Bajaur Levies force . Bajaur the smallest of the seven Federally Administered Tribal Agencies adjoins the Kunar province of Afghanistan where the TTP is said to have safe havens . The agency has also seen prolonged military operations to flush out terrorists . In mid-March , federal Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed that the TTP had split after it removed Maulvi Faqir Muhammad from the post of deputy commander . This had given rise to speculations of the TTP which is held responsible for some of the deadliest attacks inside the country getting weakened . Maulvi Faqir fell out with the TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud for warming up to the federal government 's offer for talks with terrorists as part of its give-peace-a-chance ' policy . OPEN At least 12 people were killed and over 100 wounded in a double car bombing in Russia 's LOC_Event , the deadliest militant strike for months in the troubled region , officials said on Friday . The massive blasts outside the main city of Dagestan sent huge yellow flames into the night sky , reduced cars to burned wreckage and ripped a crater into the ground , television pictures showed . Investigators said the first blast went off on the outskirts of the city of LOC_Event in the republic of Dagestan when a Lada car laden with explosives was detonated near a traffic police post damaging nearby buildings and cars but causing no fatalities . The second car bomb went off fifteen minutes later hitting policemen , rescue workers and passers-by who gathered at the scene , investigators said . The twin attacks appeared to bear the hallmarks of bombings conducted by radical militants fighting the Kremlin in the LOC_Event where they seek to establish an Islamist state . The blasts were by far the deadliest attacks in the LOC_Event this year and deal a huge blow to Kremlin hopes of restoring relative stability to a region that has been a headache for Moscow since the collapse of the former USSR . OPEN A minor blast in a car at LOC_Event in LOC_Event on Monday evening created panic in the area . According to a Delhi Police spokesperson , preliminary investigations suggested that the radiator of the car exploded because of the heat . Though no injuries were reported , the bomb disposal squad and the forensic team were called in . The incident took place around 10 p.m. OPEN : The Principal Sessions Judge and Designated Judge under TADA Act , Tiruchi , P.Velmurugan on Wednesday convicted two persons in the case pertaining to a bomb blast on railway track near Tiruchi in 1992 . The Judge awarded life imprisonment to S.Senthilkumar and sentenced D.Periyasamy to undergo five-year rigorous imprisonment . The bomb blast on railway track took place in October 1992 between LOC_Event and LOC_Event in the wee hours minutes before the ChennaiQuilon Express was to pass through damaging wooden sleepers and rails to a length of 20 feet . The case initially registered by the Vriddhachalam Railway Police was subsequently transferred to the Q Branch police , Tiruchi , for further investigation .

In the haven for expatriates from nearby countries , there are , however , few Indians and those who have remained are being asked to leave by available flights , External Affairs Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said at a news briefing here on Tuesday . We are advising the Indians to leave the country . After an assessment of the security situation , the families of embassy staff are being evacuated , he said . Although Syria is home to displaced Palestinians and Iraqis , besides people of many other nationalities and faiths , there were only 900 Indians when powerful bomb blasts starting rocking Damascus . Now there are about 100 left including the embassy staff and a few from Mother Teresas Missionaries of Charity . Last week , the Government issued a travel advisory warning Indians against visiting the country , where attacks against unarmed civilians by the Free Syrian Army and some shadowy groups have escalated in their struggle against the Bashar al-Assad regime . A bomb attack last week claimed the lives of Syrian Defence Minister and Mr. Assad 's brother-in-law . OPEN Security at vital installations and residences of senior government functionaries in the Capital was stepped up in the wake of a series of low-intensity blasts in LOC_Event on Wednesday . The security personnel deployed at the 7 Race Course Road residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were alerted and the entire area surrounding the bungalow barricaded soon after the blasts , which obstructed smooth vehicular flow . A high alert was sounded in the city and all the police stations besides special units instructed to keep a watch on any suspicious activity . Extra security personnel were also deployed in and around Metro stations , particularly those located near vital installations like Parliament and railway stations . Bomb detection and disposal squads are on stand-by . All emergency services have been activated to meet any contingency , said an officer . OPEN Not ruling out the terror angle in Wednesdays serial blasts in Pune , Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil on Thursday said only the detonators in the Improvised Explosive Devices exploded , leaving behind the other material in the bombs . Speaking to the media after a fortnightly meeting to review intelligence and security , he said prima facie , ammonium nitrate appeared to be the material used , but only a laboratory analysis can confirm it . He said there had been no specific intelligence alert for the blasts . A joint team of the Anti Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) and the Pune Crime Branch were investigating the blasts along with central investigating agencies . Set off by electronic timers , four IEDs exploded , injuring one person , even as two bombs were defused . The injured man , Dayanand Patil , a tailor , who was caught in a blast after someone placed a bomb in his bag , is being questioned by the police . Dayanand Patil is allegedly a member of social activist Anna Hazares India Against Corruption movement , but the IAC has not been linked as yet to the blasts , the Minister said . Wednesdays reports said Dayanand Patil was walking away from the IAC protest venue near Balgandharva Rang Mandir when the bomb exploded . Mr. Patil refused to speak further on this issue , saying making anything public now would jeopardise the investigation . The police gathered CCTV footage from the area on Thursday morning . Denying reports that some CCTV cameras were not working , Mr. Patil said there was adequate material available and the police were going through it . High alert The Minister was confident that the case would be cracked soon . The security agencies are on a high alert in the State after the serial blasts and Mr. Patil appealed to the public not to touch any suspicious object and to report to the police any signs of suspicious activity or movement . Case of revenge ? While no one has been detained , police are questioning a few people in Pune . After the June murder of Qateel Sheikh , suspected to be linked to the Indian Mujahideen , in Yerawada jail , the Pune police commissioner had received an anonymous letter vowing revenge for Sheikhs death . Mr. Patil said the police were investigating any possible link between the letter and the blasts . OPEN Army personnel had a narrow escape on Sunday , when a powerful remote-controlled bomb exploded in LOC_Event , near here , seconds after their truck crossed the place on the LOC_Event . The bomb buried near a tree caused a foot-deep crater . A manhunt by the police shortly after the blast drew a blank . So far , no underground organisation has claimed responsibility . Police said the explosion was part of the coordinated violent campaign against the security forces by the United National Liberation Front and the Revolutionary Peoples Front . OPEN A powerful bomb blast at LOC_Event in LOC_Event district in the early hours of Thursday created panic in the locality . The impact was so great that the petty shop where it detonated was totally ripped apart . Tension prevailed at the village since morning . The shop was owned by S. Shanmugam ( 41 ) . After inspecting the blast spot , Superintendent of Police T. Jayachandran said that investigations revealed that the bomb was a powerful one and further investigations were on to find out whether the bomb was stored by some unidentified persons in the shop . OPEN The huge cistern at LOC_Event is in for repairs . The mosque authorities have emptied it as it has developed major cracks resulting in the speedy depletion of water . The cistern is used by people for ablutions before offering namaz . During Ramzan the fast depletion of water created problems for worshippers . Therefore , we have decided to repair it properly , said Khaja Nayeemuddin , superintendent , LOC_Event . The cistern got damaged in the bomb blast at the mosque in 2007 . Ever since the water was seeping out but of late the cracks widened causing water to deplete quickly . Last Friday the cistern was completely emptied and the tiles removed to plug the leaks . OPEN Two security personnel were injured in a bomb blast triggered Wednesday by suspected militants in the Manipur capital , police said . A security alert has been sounded . The two Assam Rifles troopers were on routine patrolling when the blast hit them in the LOC_Event area , a few kilometres from the Manipur Police headquarters . Their condition is stated to be stable , an Assam Rifles official said . A security alert has been sounded and LOC_Event has been cordoned off , Imphal district police chief Konsam Jayanta Singh told IANS . He said preliminary reports suggested that the blast could have been triggered by an Improvised Explosive Device . We have found the wreckage of a scooter from the blast site , he said . No arrests had been made so far , he added . Though no rebel group has claimed responsibility for the blasts , Manipur Police and intelligence officials said the blasts were carried out by rebels . On Monday , a youth was killed in a village of Manipurs Thoubal district after a bomb , suspected to have been planted by militants , went off at his house . There are more than 20 rebel outfits in Manipur with demands ranging from secession to greater autonomy.IANS OPEN Thirty-four people were killed and 100 others injured in two bomb attacks , which targeted a security forces vehicle and a religious gathering , in the restive Pakistani provinces of LOC_Event and LOC_Event on Thursday . A powerful bomb went off under a security forces vehicle at the busy LOC_Event in LOC_Event , the capital of LOC_Event , killing 12 people and injuring 40 others . In the second incident , 22 people were killed and nearly 70 people were injured in an explosion at a tablighi markaz ( preaching centre ) in the LOC_Event of the LOC_Event province in the evening . Radio Pakistan reported that the blast was caused by a gas cylinder , but police officials subsequently described it as an act of terrorism . PTI OPEN A massive explosion was heard near Gao in northern LOC_Event late Saturday , hours after villagers near the city detained two youths preparing for suicide bombings . A French military source said the blast occurred some 10 km away from the French military base at the citys airport , but could provide no further details . An AFP correspondent said the blast was audible from Gao , the main city in northern LOC_Event which was only recaptured from the Islamists late last month . The city was already on edge after what is thought to have been Malis first suicide attack on Friday , when a young Tuareg blew himself up , slightly injuring a Malian soldier . Malian troops reinforced checkpoints with sandbags and heavy machine-guns and stepped patrols . Then on Saturday morning , residents of a village near Gao detained two young men they said were carrying explosive belts on the road leading to the site of Fridays attack . The attacks came as reports said the bodies of several people , including three Arab shopkeepers arrested by troops , had been discovered in a grave in Timbuktu . Timbuktu has been the scene of reprisal attacks by black Malians against Arab and Tuareg residents accused of supporting the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist rebels who until recently occupied the city . AFP OPEN The death toll in Saturdays bomb blast near LOC_Event Town in LOC_Event climbed to 84 and triggered another wave of protest across the country against sectarian violence and the inability of the powers that be to round up the terrorists unleashing such carnage with regular impunity . Most of the dead were LOC_Event Shias , a community that has been repeatedly targeted over the past couple of years . The dead included many women and children , some of whom were charred beyond recognition because of the fire that followed the massive explosion heard all over LOC_Event . The banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi ( LeJ ) claimed responsibility for the attack and said the target was the Shia community of LOC_Event Town . Members of the LOC_Event Shia community picketed a thoroughfare of LOC_Event on Sunday demanding action against LeJ and refusing to bury those killed until those responsible were rounded up . A similar protest in January following serial blasts in LOC_Event targeting the LOC_Event Shias saw the federal government dismiss the provincial government and declare Governors Rule in Balochistan . Since Governors Rule and more powers to the security forces in the province have had little impact on sectarian violence , the LOC_Event Shias this time round have become more vocal in demanding action against LeJ despite the inherent risks in naming the organisation that wants Shias to be declared infidels in LOC_Event . Even as protests spread to different parts of the country including Islamabad , Lahore and Karachi mass graves were dug in LOC_Event for the burial of those killed in the blast . Emotionally drained by the unrelenting attack on their community , the LOC_Event Shias lamented that they now had no burial space for their dead such is the rate at which they are being killed . OPEN A bomb blast close to the Dimapur railway station in the poll-bound Nagaland killed a person on Wednesday morning . OPEN Panic and chaos prevailed at the Osmania General Hospital , which received the dead and the injured of the bomb blasts that shook Dilsukhnagar on Thur-sday . Police prevented people from going inside the wards and relatives of the injured were panic-stricken unable to find out the status of their dear ones . Bodies kept piling in the hospital mortuary . Abdul Gaffar , 40 , an auto driver from Santoshnagar , went out during afternoon , and his family next heard of him only after receiving a call in the evening about his being injured in the blast . His wife rushed to the hospital along with their three children , two sons and a daughter . They waited anxiously outside the wards even as the injured were being treated inside with wails of the dear family members renting the air . Injured in dozens could be found in the casualty ward , even after many were shifted to operation theatres . Yadaiah , another Santoshnagar resident and a collection agent with a real estate company , and stayed at Santoshnagar . He was travelling on his two-wheeler when he was injured in the blast near Konark theatre . Someone informed his brother , who rushed to the hospital . Some injured were conscious enough to share horrific details about the blasts . Sudhakar , 38 , a resident of Gaddiannaram , was injured in hands and abdomen . He sells snacks every day near Konark Theatre , and heard the sound of a big blast before collapsing with injuries . Same was the case with Saidha Naik , 19 , a B.Tech . ( Civil ) student from Sri Datta Engineering College . He came every day to Dilsukhnagar for attending a class on Autocad and got injured in the blast . C. Ravi , a 35-year-old carpenter was travelling along with his brother-in-law Lakshman on a two-wheeler when the blast happened . I was waiting near the traffic signals when blast occurred . For two months we have been working in Dilsukhnagar and would usually leave only after midnight . On Thursday , we left early due to some work , and got injured in the blast . I can not locate my brother-in-law , he said . Meanwhile a press release from the Ranga Reddy district collectorate informed that the injured have been shifted to Gandhi Hospital , Musheerabad , Omni Hospital , Kothapet and Yashoda Hospital , Malakpet . People rush to help There was no dearth of good Samaritans at the hospital , who helped the relatives and the injured . Many volunteered to donate blood , and some distributed water bottles . Some others took it upon themselves to inform the relatives of the injured about the incident . RTC buses were pressed in to service carry the injured people to the hospital . The scene at the hospital mortuary was heart-rending , as relatives broke down inconsolably after identifying the bodies of their kin . OPEN Bloodstains , debris and mangled body parts strewn around were all that remained at the two locations in LOC_Event where blasts happened in quick succession on Thursday evening . Eyewitness accounts recall two blasts between 6.45 p.m. and 7 p.m. near the Konark theatre and LOC_Event , respectively , resulting in widespread mayhem . After the first blast near the bus-stop , panicky crowds rushed towards the Konark theatre before the second bomb went off near a small tiffin centre opposite the theatre . M. Naresh , an MBA student who worked as an intern in an IT consultancy nearby , recalled having seen 20 to 30 people with bleeding injuries running towards a private hospital , soon after the second blast . Five to six mangled bodies were found lying there . The first blast near the bus-stop was no less horrific . I heard a big explosion around 7 p.m. Smoke enveloped the whole area , and after it cleared , I could see six to seven people bleeding profusely . Limbs were broken and for some , the intestines had been ripped out . Soon , they were shifted to hospital , recounted L. Narsing Rao from Vani Leather Shop near the bus-stop . Rakesh , another shopkeeper , said many people had gathered outside a watch repair shop when the blast happened . Most of them fell down . The impact was so powerful that mirrors and glass doors of shops up to the third floor of the Giriji Lokeshnand Complex where the incident happened , were shattered totally . A shop named Dress Code received the maximum impact near the location . Two youngsters Rafi , 24 and Laddu , 26 who sat on the steps of the shop were seriously injured . Viewers inside the Konark theatre rushed out as the floor under their feet shook due to the blast impact . Chaos prevailed at the blast location in LOC_Event . Police forced closure of shops , as rumours were rife about more bombs at other locations . Phones were jammed , and SMSs could not be sent out . Parents frantically calling their wards could not connect immediately , resulting in widespread panic . OPEN There are some striking similarities between the explosions that rocked LOC_Event on Thursday evening and the ones near LOC_Event at LOC_Event and LOC_Event in August 2007 . The most significant among them was the timing chosen by the terrorists to strike ; it was 7.30 p.m. at LOC_Event and 7.35 p.m. at LOC_Event on the fateful evening of August 25 when it was drizzling . On Thursday , the twin blasts at LOC_Event went off at 6.58 pm and 7.01 p.m. respectively . The police said the terrorists chose evenings for the bloodshed on both occasions in an attempt to inflict maximum damage as the movement of public on roads was high and their escape was facilitated by darkness . Perhaps more striking in the two incidents separated by a gap of five-and-a-half years was the location chosen on Thursday . The blasts occurred right across the road at LOC_Event where the terrorists failed to explode a bomb simultaneously with those at LOC_Event and LOC_Event . They had chosen three locations for the serial blasts but succeeded only at two , killing 42 persons . The unexploded bomb was kept in the boot of a scooter parked near the foot-over bridge which was 50 metres away from the present sites . What is significant is that the Saroornagar police station is a stones throw away . A senior police officer said the modus operandi of terrorists , the explosive material used and the locations fell into a pattern in all these blasts . The explosives were nitrogen-based and wrapped in cotton cloth at LOC_Event and in rexine at LOC_Event . The terrorists appeared to have gone in for a locally-made bomb which anybody could assemble as plastic explosives were no longer easy to acquire . The only difference was the use of bicycles in the latest incident . Explosives wrapped in cotton cloth at LOC_Event and in rexine at LOC_Event similarity with Saibaba temple blast in 2002 Explosives wrapped in cotton cloth at LOC_Event and in rexine at LOC_Event No similarity with Saibaba temple blast in 2002 OPEN Andhra Pradesh Home Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy on Saturday said she was confident about the police cracking the LOC_Event twin blasts case and said 15 teams had been pressed into service for tracing the culprits . Addressing a media conference after a high level review meeting chaired by Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy , she announced a Rs . 10-lakh reward for those who would give information that could help solve the case . She said the government had decided to install closed-circuit ( CC ) cameras within the next six months at about 3,500 locations in the city at an estimated cost of Rs . 450-crore . . The government would make it mandatory to install surveillance cameras in malls , hospitals , cinema halls and other places which attract crowds . On the progress made by the investigators , she said : The Centre and State government are confident of achieving some breakthrough very soon . The Counter Intelligence Force of the State , those from CID and National Investigation Agency are on the job . Ms. Sabitha denied that the police had ignored any bomb threat call . The alleged involvement of Indian Mujahideen in the blasts was also yet to be established , she noted . In all , 16 persons were killed in the ghastly incident so far and 15 bodies were handed over to the family members concerned . Among the injured , condition of five to six persons was critical . Asked about criticism over alleged intelligence failure , she said investigation was under progress and if any laxity was found action would be initiated against those responsible . The Home Minister however added that the State had stepped up searches and checks whenever Centre issued alerts . The vulnerable areas were scanned thoroughly only 15 days ago yet unfortunately the bomb blasts could not be prevented . No arrest so far Meanwhile , the city Police Commissioner , Anurag Sharma told journalists that no one had yet been taken into custody so far and Abdul Wasey , twice-injured in terror attacks , was not a suspect in the case . The city police team has merely recorded his statement and spoken to his family members . Wasey was working in a footwear shop close to the blast spot . OPEN Even after six days after the twin explosions snuffed out 16 lives in the citys densely populated LOC_Event , the leads available are taking the investigators nowhere . With no terror group claiming responsibility for the deadly terror strike and the lack of clinching evidence to indicate the involvement of pan-Islamic organisations or right wing terror outfits , forensic data became the soul source to draw inferences . The bomb signature - usage of factory-made ammonium nitrate like supergel and detonation with timers - swung the needle of suspicion towards the banned Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , which is believed to behind similar blasts earlier . The latest terror attacks in IMs account - August , 2012 , in LOC_Event and February , 2011 , in LOC_Event - are akin to those at LOC_Event since improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) were detonated with timers . Compelled by this evidence , agencies probing the incident are racking their brains to identify as to who could have engineered the blasts . But they are not prepared to name the IM as the organisation behind the attacks . OPEN Police investigating the LOC_Event received a shot in the arm on Wednesday when they stumbled upon the video footage of a purported suspect recorded by surveillance cameras of a noted cloth store . The footage is of high quality , but , unfortunately , the suspects face does not figure in it . Yet police hope it will help them to narrow down the suspects by preparing portrait parley vis -- vis video footages recorded by other cameras . The suspect in the cloth-store cameras video footage was seen for a few minutes , but most of the time his back was towards the camera , a police officer said . Not leaving anything to chance , police had collected video footage captured by different cameras in and around LOC_Event . An analysis of the visuals indicated that the bomb planters came from either the Gaddiannaram side or the lane near the Dilsukhnagar bus depot . These images raise suspicion if the tall man , wearing a pair of white socks and black shoes , who was seen always keeping his right hand in his pants pocket , used a remote control device to detonate the improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . Our conjecture is a timer was used to explode the IEDs , but the possibility of using the remote control device can not be ruled out , forensic experts remarked . They are sure it is not akin to the TV remote control device , which is made with infra red technology . For this , the line of sight joining the target and the control device is compulsory . Interestingly , chances are there that the radiofrequency signal technology adopted in cars to make remote control operations can be used to trigger a bomb . It can be operated from a distance of even 500 meters if a high-quality transmitter and antennas are used , experts maintained . Interestingly , so far police have not found any trace of evidence confirming that a timer was used for triggering the blasts . Investigators are yet to find traces of any of these to conclusively say that a timer mechanism was used for the detonation of IEDs . OPEN When the going gets tough , the tough gets going or so says an old clich . But when the twin blasts rocked LOC_Event and spread waves of shock and panic , undeterred local youth stood ground and formed the first line of rescue operations . Armed with sticks , the youth assisted the police officials in shifting the bodies and injured persons , helped in cordoning off the blast sites and tried to bring the situation under control before additional police forces could be rushed in . The area got engulfed in pitch darkness when the bomb went off . The commotion created by flames and dismembered bodies was such that most of us could not gather our wits to formulate a response , Sadanand , owner of a shop in the neighbourhood recounts . It was the youth from numerous hostels in the vicinities who poured out to extend their help , he adds . The local Police Inspector came to the spot within three minutes and first ambulance rushed to the spot soon after that , but it was few large-hearted people who came forward to douse the flames and plunge into the rescue operations , K. Arun Kishore , another shopkeeper recounts . Once the rescue operations picked up , more people started trickling in , he says , adding that soon it became difficult to control people who started trampling the area . The injured were rushed to the nearest private hospitals and those who received serious injuries were shifted to bigger hospitals like Care , Omni and Yashoda . We received about 30 victims on Thursday , most were treated as out-patients or were sent to other hospitals , Dr. Santosh Kumar from Sai Ram Speciality Hospital says . The injured were brought to the hospital by the neighbourhood youth , he maintains . A major helping hand was also extended by the local political party cadres . Our people swung into action immediately and we mobilised our cadre within minutes , local TDP representative E. Lokendra Nath claims . The situation was similar at the first bomb blast site near 72 number bus-stop . It was initially dark as all bulbs in the area got fused and it was difficult to make out anything , Abdul Kotadiya owner of Dress Code , the store in front of which the bomb went off , says . The glass panes were shattered , bulbs gone , ears ringing with the after effects of the blasts . The scene was macabre and we did not know what to do . But soon youngsters poured in and started helping the injured , he recounts . Nemmani Sreedhar OPEN The Delhi Police have filed a supplementary charge sheet in the Israeli diplomat attack case furnishing details of vehicles used in the blast and over 4,900 mobile-phone calls . One of the suspects The charge sheet in the February 13 , 2012 , bomb attack case filed in the court of Additional Sessions Judge Asha Menon contains the verification report from the Transport department of the vehicles used by Houshang Afshar Irani to recce the Israeli Embassy and to plant the bomb on the diplomats vehicle . Irani was one of the four suspects named in the main charge sheet filed on August 31 , 2012 , in connection with the incident .

He is currently on bail . The supplementary charge sheet also contained a sanction to prosecute Kazmi under the Explosive Substances Act . The police told the court that the replies to the Letters Rogatory , executed to Georgia , Malaysia , Thailand , Iran and Israel , were still awaited and would be submitted through another supplementary charge sheet . OPEN Tihar Jail authorities were on Friday directed by a Delhi court to produce before it tomorrow the two arrested Indian Mujahideen operatives whose roles are under investigation in connection with the February 21 LOC_Event twin blasts case which claimed 16 lives and left 79 injured . The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has moved an application seeking further custodial interrogation of Syed Maqbool and Imran Khan during which they would be confronted with another alleged IM operative Obaid-Ur-Rehman , who has been brought from Bangalore Central Jail and is presently in NIA 's custody till March 20 in connection with the case . During an in-chamber hearing , District Judge I S Mehta allowed NIA 's plea and issued production warrants against Maqbool and Imran , who are currently lodged in Tihar Jail under judicial custody , the court sources said . Conflicting statements The sources said the NIA told the court that they need to confront both Maqbool and Imran with Obaid-Ur-Rehman as some conflicting statements have been given by them during their separate interrogation . Maqbool and Imran were earlier remanded to NIA 's custody for five days by the court during which they were taken to LOC_Event in connection with the blasts . Rehman was remanded to NIA 's custody on March 13 after the agency had submitted that his custodial interrogation was required to unearth the entire conspiracy which led to the bombings . He was brought from Bangalore jail after the court had issued production warrant against him . Sources had said the NIA had told the court that Rehman was a key IM operative and he may give some vital information against the banned group 's members who were involved in the blasts . The NIA had told the court that Maqbool and Imran had revealed some important facts about the blasts , the sources had said . Maqbool and Imran were lodged in Tihar Jail after their arrest by Delhi Police in the August 2012 LOC_Event blast case . The NIA had told the court that the duo did a recce at LOC_Event 's LOC_Event area where the blasts took place . The court had also issued non-bailable warrants against IM founder Riyaz Bhatkal and nine other operatives of the banned group in connection with the LOC_Event blasts Iqbal Bhatkal , Mohsim Chaudhary , Amir Reza Khan , Shahnawaz Alam , Asadullah Akhtar , Ariz Khan , Mohd Khalid , Mirza Shadaab Beg and Mohd Sajid . According to the sources , the NIA had told the judge that the conspiracy behind the LOC_Event blasts was hatched by the IM modules and the blasts took place on the alleged instructions of Riyaz Bhatkal . - PTI OPEN A wave of bombings tore through the LOC_Event area on Tuesday , killing 57 people on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion . The symbolism of Tuesdays attacks was strong , coming 10 years to the day that Washington launched the invasion with a shock and awe campaign of airstrikes on March 19 , 2003 before dawn the following day in LOC_Event . The military action quickly ousted Saddam Hussein but led to years of bloodshed as Sunni and Shia militants battled U.S. forces and each other , leaving nearly 4,500 Americans and more than 100,000 Iraqis killed . Tuesdays apparently coordinated attacks included car bombs and explosives stuck to the underside of vehicles . They targeted government security forces and mainly Shia areas , small restaurants , day labourers and bus stops over a span of more than two hours , according to police and hospital officials . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts , but they bore hallmarks of al-Qaeda in LOC_Event . The terror group , which favours car bombs and coordinated bombings intended to undermine public confidence in the government , has sought to reassert its presence in recent weeks . The violence started at around 8 a.m. Tuesday , when a bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in LOC_Event neighbourhood , killing four peopleThe deadliest attack was a 10 a.m. car bombing near the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in LOC_Event eastern LOC_Event neighbourhood , which killed seven people . Underscoring the political tensions , LOC_Event Cabinet also decided on Tuesday to postpone elections in two provinces dominated by the countrys minority Sunnis for up to six months . AP OPEN The memory refuses to fade away . It is over a month , but the pathetic sight of a young girl dying in his arms keeps flashing in his mind . She breathed her last in my arms as I was shifting her into a bus . I felt wretched , said Shaik Jani Pasha , an RTC driver , as he recalled the scenes from the twin blasts at LOC_Event on February 21 . On the dreadful day , when most ran helter-skelter after the bombs went off , Pasha rushed to the site to help the injured . In fact , it was his initiative that saved many lives . As the blast at Anand tiffin centre ripped through the market , motorcycles flew up in the air , and people fell apart .

OPEN Delay in the release of ex-gratia amount to the victims of LOC_Event twin bomb blasts is forcing patients to take readmissions at Care Hospital , Nampally .

He was produced in the Judicial Magistrates Court on Monday afternoon . Initially , a news agency put out a report stating that he was held in connection with the Hyderabad blasts , sending everyone into a tizzy here . But , the NIA officials later clarified that his arrest had no connection with the recent twin explosions at LOC_Event . However , there is a connection to the city in the sense that Danish Iqbal , who was working for an IT company here , took part in a militant training camp organised by SIMI along with Imam and 50 others at Wagamon near Kochi , in 2010 . They underwent firing practice , handling of explosives and detonation of bombs , a NIA officer said . They were taught on ways to escape from a police raid .

Among the nearly 27,000 runners in the worlds oldest marathon , those making their way towards the final stretch of the 26.2-mile run may have felt nothing but a combination of exhilaration and exhaustion . Yet as they approached the finish line at 2.45 p.m. on Monday the unsuspecting runners were violently hurled to the ground by the force of a powerful shockwave from coordinated twin blasts of shrapnel-spewing bombs . The blasts , which President Barack Obama described as a heinous and cowardly act ... of terror , left at least three persons dead and more than 176 injured . Speaking in a subdued but determined tone at the White House three hours after the explosions and again on Tuesday morning , Mr. Obama admitted : What we dont yet know , however , is who carried out this attack , or why ; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organisation , foreign or domestic , or was the act of a malevolent individual . He further cautioned that people shouldnt jump to conclusions before we have all the facts . He , however , left little doubt that his administration would pursue those responsible for the first major terror attack since 9/11 with vigour . He promised , We will get to the bottom of this ... Any responsible individuals , any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice . He took time to praise Bostonians for their generosity towards victims and their families , and to commend first responders and law enforcement agencies . FBI investigation At a press conference on Monday night , the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was taking charge of the bombings probe . On Tuesday morning , The Boston Globe reported that the FBI had raided the Waters Edge apartment complex at 364 Ocean Avenue , fuelling questions about home-grown terror . Victims were being brought in to the Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , the Tufts Medical Centre , Brigham , and the Womens Hospital and other area hospitals . Seventeen patients were said to be in a critical condition . Among the dead was eight-year-old Martin Richards . OPEN The LOC_Event Marathon bombings of Monday afternoon marked the first major terror attack carried out on LOC_Event soil since al Qaeda struck with devastating force on September 11 , 2001 . With three confirmed dead , among them an eight-year-old boy waiting for his father at the finish line , and local hospitals receiving at least 176 persons , many with serious injuries and some requiring amputation , the city of LOC_Event turned from jubilation to stunned silence . Shortly before 3 pm , a quarter of a mile or so before the finish line , two loud blasts went off within seconds of each other . Spectators and runners knocked over by the force of the blast sat amidst blood and debris on the road . Doctors treating the injured were said to be pulling ball-bearings and shrapnel out of people , suggesting a bomb designed for lethal impact . LOC_Event law enforcement , which did not appear to have any advance intelligence of the incident , went into fourth gear immediately . Major cities were put on high alert , and a no-fly zone and temporary airport ground stop were imposed in LOC_Event . On Tuesday morning the Federal Bureau of Investigation , now in charge of the criminal investigation into the attack , raided a high-rise apartment in LOC_Event in search of a person of interest . In a statement made a few hours after the attack , President Barack Obama seemed to be conscious of the legacy of suspicion that followed 9/11 , particularly the violent backlash against Muslims , Sikhs and other ethnic minorities . We dont yet have all the answers , he said . We still do not know who did this or why ... People shouldnt jump to conclusions before we have all the facts . Yet even as he spoke there were unconfirmed reports in the media about a Saudi national said to have been questioned at a hospital . Some media outlets got ahead of themselves , speculating over whether foreign or home-grown terror groups could be involved . Yet as of Tuesday , the authorities made it clear they had no concrete leads . After nearly a decade of polarising experience with hate crimes , Islamophobia and the suspension of civil liberties under legislation such as the LOC_Event Patriot Act , it is only in the past few years that the LOC_Event has enacted stronger protections for minorities and free speech . There is a real risk that Mondays bombing and Mr. Obamas promise that the attackers would feel the full weight of justice may lead to the rollback of these hard-fought rights . If they do , it may once again draw the LOC_Event back into a negative spiral of injurious overreach in foreign policy and domestic policing that will damage the civilisational fabric of America without making the country any more secure .

Deputy Election Commissioner Alok Shukla , in-charge of the LOC_Event elections , told The Hindu that according to information received by the Commission , the incident was suspected to be a terror act . Informed sources said if necessary more Central security forces and police forces from other States would be sent to LOC_Event to ensure that elections passed off peacefully . Personal security to star campaigners would be tightened . Meanwhile , BJP president Rajnath Singh , in an interaction with women journalists here , termed the blast unfortunate . This terror act appeared to be the job of some sleeper cells active due to lack of efforts in fighting terror by the Union government . He refused to react to Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed 's contention that the blast would help the BJP in the polls . I dont believe this has been stage-managed by somebody . Terror acts are occurring across the country . It is a ground reality that there are several sleeper modules which are playing their roles in different places . The Central government is not making any effort to destroy these sleeper cells , he said . Fight terror unitedly Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi distanced himself from Mr. Ahmed 's tweet on the LOC_Event blast by stating that the party did not view terrorism in terms of political benefit or loss . We all know terrorism is a national issue or problem . Not only that , to some extent it is an international problem . We do not view the problem in terms of political benefit or loss , he told journalists here . The problem of terrorism should be a concern for all the citizens and should be faced unitedly .

He was in touch with the State government and the police , he told journalists . Advisory to States Meanwhile , the MHA issued an advisory to all States asking them to beef up security and enhance deployment of police personnel , particularly in and around sensitive and crowded locations like places of worship , markets and malls . Sources in the MHA said Indian Mujahideen , which is allegedly responsible for recent blasts in LOC_Event and LOC_Event , could be behind the LOC_Event blast . Though it is too early to name any organisation , the evidence gathered so far by probe agencies indicates that it could be the handiwork of the Indian Mujahideen . The use of improvised explosive device and ammonium nitrate is what the banned outfit had used in the past as well , the sources said . OPEN Less than 48 hours after two lethal bombs went off near the finish line of the LOC_Event Marathon , killing three and injuring more than 170 , federal investigators were said to have identified a suspect after examining a security video shot from a nearby department store . The Associated Press said on Twitter Law enforcement official : Arrest imminent in LOC_Event Marathon bombing , suspect to be brought to court , while CNN news channel reported that after analysing CCTV footage from the Lord & Taylor shop at Boylston Street An arrest has been ... based on two videos showing images of the suspect .

The FBI also said no arrest was made and urged the media to exercise caution . Both AP and CNN quoted an unnamed law enforcement official with CNNs John King saying a second source briefed on the investigation said the suspect placed at least one of the bombs and walked away . Meanwhile , The Boston Globe reported that authorities had an image of a suspect carrying , and possibly dropping , a bag at the second bombing scene , just outside the Forum restaurant . The news of the suspects identification and possible arrest came after authorities revealed on Tuesday that the attacker used pressure cookers packed with metal nails and ball bearings as part of the bomb design .

The Minister said the Centre had been alerting all States for the last two-three months about possible terror attacks , particularly in metro cities . However , no specific alert had been issued to any State about the possibility of a religious place being targeted . Whenever we have any specific information , we immediately share it with the State concerned . OPEN The LOC_Event High Court on Thursday cancelled the bail granted by a sessions court to two accused Devender Gupta and Lokender Gupta -- in the LOC_Event bomb blasts case of 2007 . The lower court had granted bail to them five months ago . This grant of bail was challenged by the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) in the High Court .

The accused have been merely charged with `` causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means , attempt to murder and destroying evidence among others . '' The reaction of the West Bengal government or the state police is shocking as the accidental explosion of 2 October could have thwarted a possible serious terrorist strike on West Bengal . The report added that the serious terrorism charges were not slapped so that the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) is kept at bay from investigating the case . Speaking to HT on condition of anonymity , an NIA official said : `` None of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ) provisions that deal with terror and anti-national activities have been evoked '' But this is just the tip of the iceberg if you start counting the major loopholes in the case . In an earlier Firstpost article , author Sandip Roy notes how the LOC_Event Blast is a bigger issue than it is actually made out to be . Recovered cache of bombs were detonated ( not defused ) by the state police on the orders of the Bengal DGP even before the NIA could reached the blast site . Ved Marwah , former director-general of the elite anti-terror force , NSG , told Telegraph : `` It 's a criminal offence and the police seniors who gave the order should be prosecuted for criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence . '' By blowing up the remaining cache , the Bengal police not only showed stupidity but they also destroyed crucial evidence which could have helped agencies identify the terror outfit . The state police although said detonating cache is the Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) . Former director-general of the BSF and Uttar Pradesh police , Prakash Singh , however , told The Telegraph that if Bengal police was following SOP , they should have consulted the Intelligence Bureau whether to defuse or detonate the bombs . `` Without any potential for danger , there can be no question of detonation . The police can not decide on their own without consulting experts ... Going by their unexplained haste , it seems the state police did not want to let the matter go into the public domain , '' Singh told Telegraph . The lack of NIA 's involvement in the case is also bizarre . In a report in The Hindu , a senior Union home ministry official said that the government is undecided on the agency 's involvement in the case . According to the report , Mamata 's government had not even approached the NIA to probe the case but according to a senior official of NIA that is not a problem . The article noted : The NIA Act of 2008 says that if the Central Government is of the `` opinion '' that an offence is required `` to be investigated under NIA Act , it may suo motu direct the Agency to investigate . '' `` So , we do not need a go-ahead from any State Government to investigate the LOC_Event blast under the Act , '' said the Home Ministry official . The Trinamool government and the West Bengal police 's reaction after the blast came under much of flak as well . The Left Front and the BJP alleged a nexus between the Mamata government and the militants . BJP secretary Siddharth Nath Singh had earlier said : `` We can safely conclude that West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee 's rule has become a safe haven for anti-national elements and Jihadi activities . '' Prakash Singh raised questions on the government 's role and how it should have informed the agency which is the pivotal body in handling terror-related cases . NIA director Sharad Kumar confirmed that the West Bengal government had not asked for assistance in the case . As of now , the LOC_Event blast case is shrouded by many mysterious questions which have not been answered . The fact , that the owner of the building which blew up Nurul Hasan Chowdhary was a Trinamool Congress leader - and lived across the street and that the ground floor of the building was used as the TMC party office - can not be ignored . Speculations are many but answers are really few . OPEN The body of the LOC_Event blast accused Abdul Karim was on Wednesday handed over to his family in the presence of NIA officials and local police officers . The body , which was kept in the police morgue at the Burdwan Medical College , was handed over to Karim 's father and his cousin Amirul Hossain after identification , police sources said.Hossain told media present at the hospital that they had identified the blast accused to be Karim from his photos published in the papers . Karim had left his home in Kafirpur village in Kinnahar in neighbouring Birbhum district about two and a half months before the LOC_Event blast on 2 October and had gone off to Kerala . He had not maintained any relations with his family since his departure , Hossain added . The body would be taken to Kafirpur where the last rites would be performed , Hossain said . Apart from the four member NIA team , the LOC_Event police station Inspector-in-charge Abdul Gaffar and Sub-Inspector , who was the first Investigating Officer , Akash Munshi was present during the handing over of the body . The body of the other accused , Shakil Gazi alias Shakil Ahmed , who was also killed in the blast is yet to be claimed , police said . It is suspected both had links with banned terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) .

The delegation will share information with the NIA to help it locate more suspects , '' said Kamal . OPEN Three more suspects have been arrested here in connection with the blast in West Bengal 's LOC_Event , amid a joint India-Bangla operation along the borders to nab over 100 militants of the outlawed Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) . `` The three are members of JMB . We are suspecting that they have links with bomb-making ( materials ) discovered after the explosions in LOC_Event , '' a senior official of Dhaka Metropolitan Police ( DMP ) told reporters on Monday . Deputy commissioner Masudur Rahman briefly said three JMB activists have been arrested from the capital last night and the details would be disclosed later at a press briefing here . Another official familiar with the arrest said the three suspected militants were arrested along with some explosives . The arrest came shortly after a Bangladeshi security team returned home after sharing info on the issue with officials in India . Earlier , an National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) from India delegation visited Dhaka . A member of the Bangladesh delegation that returned home yesterday told reporters that law enforcement agencies of the two countries already launched simultaneous drives in their territories to capture over a hundred JMB operatives in line with a decision taken during the NIA team 's Bangladesh visit . `` The drives are being carried out following the exchange of concrete information between investigators of the two neighbours regarding operatives of the banned outfit in India and Bangladesh , '' the official told the Daily Star newspaper . He said JMB militants who crossed the border are already on the run as Indian investigators are desperately looking for them after the LOC_Event blast . On October 2 , two suspected JMB operatives were killed and another injured in an explosion at a house in LOC_Event area , bordering Bangladesh . Earlier , Bangladesh police said they had arrested five operatives of JMB including its women front chief and wife of alleged key mastermind of the Bardhaman blast Sajid under an intensified campaign against Islamists .

He alleged that the Opposition was making irresponsible comments . Biman Bose , CPI -LRB- M -RRB- State secretary , and the BJP are trying to disturb the peace and thus denigrate the government ... by making irresponsible statements . . . Denying the allegation that the house where the blast occurred had a Trinamool office , Mr. Roy said it must be substantiated . . . Local people would have known , if the house had the Trinamool office . Electronic media would have filmed ... do you have any footage that establishes that the house had -LRB- party -RRB- office , he asked . . .

BJP charge . . BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said at a press conference in Delhi that Bangladeshi infiltrators had rented the housed . Mr. Singh said : The local police destroyed all evidence to cover up the incident so that the Trinamool remained above suspicion . . . The local police collected samples and destroyed it within seven hours . The evidence included mobile phones , ID , IM proofs and al-Qaedas jihadi literature . Since the Central forces were informed late , they could not reach on time . All these raise questions on the Mamata Banerjee government , Mr. Singh said . . . Central agency sources told The Hindu that their officials were not allowed entry into the house even two days after the explosion . However , West Bengal Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee denied non-cooperation with the Central agencies . . .

The West Bengal unit of the BJP is blaming Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for blocking a probe by the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- into last Thursdays blast in LOC_Event . But officials at the Centre said it was the Union government that was yet to decide on handing over the probe to the central agency . . . A senior official attached to the NIA in Delhi too said the Home Ministry had not approached them to probe the blast , in which two persons were killed . Bangladesh has asked India to share any details of the LOC_Event blast investigation that point to the hand of Islamist terror groups on its soil . . . The West Bengal police are investigating if any of the four people arrested for the October 2 blast at the house of a local Trinamool Congress supporter have links with underground or terrorist groups in Bangladesh . . .

The Minister said the Government of Bangladesh has not allowed its territory to be used for anti-Indian activities . . . We have dismantled several camps along the border which were involved in such activities , Mr. Khan said . The Union Home Ministry has sought a report from the West Bengal government on the LOC_Event blast case , in which four persons have been arrested . The Centre is yet to take a decision on handing over the case to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- . . . Given that the West Bengal Police have invoked the Unlawful Activities -LRB- Prevention -RRB- Act provisions pertaining to allegations of terror act , conspiracy , organising terror training camps and harbouring , the case falls within NIA jurisdiction . . . Scheduled Offences . . The Act is among the laws listed in the Scheduled Offences category of the NIA Act , empowering the agency to conduct the investigation . . . The Centre can transfer cases of scheduled offences to the NIA , either based on the report submitted by the State government as provided under Section 6 -LRB- 4 -RRB- or suo motu under Section 6 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the NIA Act . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- will now probe the Bengal blast case . The Union Home Ministry has ordered to register a case under NIA Act , a senior Home Ministry official has confirmed on Thursday . . . The West Bengal Government will now be legally bound to hand over evidences and documents related to last weeks Bardhaman blast to the NIA officials , who are expected to arrive in the city shortly . . . The blast had killed two persons in a colony in Bardhaman district on October 2 . According to the police , the blast has brought to light a terror network , hitherto unknown in West Bengal . In the wake of the blast in West Bengals LOC_Event district which has raised serious security concerns , it has come to light that the State government has rendered the Security Commission defunct . The Supreme Court had directed setting up of the Commission in 2006 . . . It was in June 2010 that the Left Front Government brought out a gazette notification setting up the West Bengal State Security Commission which shall deliberate on the security concerns of the State among other issues . . . The Commission was to be headed by the Home Minister but the government appointed the then Health Minister , Surjya Kanta Mishra , as its Chairman . In December 2010 , the Supreme Court asked the State government to comply with the order in letter and spirit and appoint Home Minister as its chairperson . . . Commenting on the issue , Dr Mishra , who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly , told The Hindu that he had written to the Governor and as well as the State government pointing out that the Commission was a Constitutional obligation and that it be reconstituted . He said he hasnt received any answer . . . This government feels that having such a functioning commission would undermine its powers to take arbitrary decisions and ensure lack of transparency in its functioning , Dr Mishra added . . . Retired General Sankar Roychowdhury who was the member of the Commission appointed by the Left Front Government also admitted that he had not heard about the Commission since 2010 . . . In my opinion , it was not taken seriously by the Government after 2010 , Mr Roychowdhury said . . . On being contacted , senior Minister Partha Chatterjee , who was the Leader of Opposition in the previous Left Front regime , said he was not aware of the Commission and asked to check the website of the Home Department instead . The website has no mention of the Commission . . . In fact , the government has not responded to RTI queries made by international NGO , Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative -LRB- CHRI -RRB- , which has prepared a report on the functioning of the State Security Commission all across the country . . . Anirudha Nagar , programme officer of CHRI who has worked on the report , said the organisation filed RTI queries in April 2013 to the office of State Director General of Police , which was later transferred to the Home department but no response has come from the government . . . States like Delhi and Kerala have set up the Commission and they hold regular meetings , Mr Nagar added . A day after the Union Home Ministry directed National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- to take over investigation in the accidental blast at LOC_Event district of West Bengal , Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday that there is an increasing trend of interference by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre in the matters of the State . . . I feel like sharing with my Facebook friends that ever since the new government has come to power at the Centre , there is an increasing trend of interference by the Central Government in the State matters , the Chief Minister wrote on her Facebook page . . . Accusing the Central Government of frequently and unnecessarily interfering in State matters , Ms. Banerjee said such interference is not at all expected as per the Constitution . . . The beauty of federal structure is the jurisdiction of working between the Centre and the State , Ms. Banerjee said and added : Primarily , the role of the Central Government is to deal with matters concerning major policies/decision making issues . It is expected that Centre and the States do not encroach upon the areas of activities of others . Ms. Banerjee further said that the Central Government is acting like a political party rather than a national government . . . She also alleged that with the active support of the Central Government controversial matters are aired in electronic media like Doordarshan and private channels resulting in communal tension in different States . . . In the post , the Chief Minister made no reference to the NIA probe in the LOC_Event blast , but the remarks are being made at a time when her party colleagues were opposing the probe by the Central agency . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- registered a case on Friday in connection with the LOC_Event blast in West Bengal and sent a team for examining the crime scene . . . The NIA says the two persons killed in the October 2 explosion are believed to be Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh members . While the case will be investigated by the agencys Kolkata branch , two senior officials have been sent for supervision . . . Ten persons , two of them women , have been held in connection with the blast . Six of the suspects were tracked down to Barpeta in Assam . The NIA will take the suspects into custody for questioning . . . There is evidence to suggest that those involved had links in Bangladesh . If necessary , we will also contact Bangladeshi authorities seeking cooperation in the probe . The material evidence will be sent for forensic examination and analysis . The case papers are being handed over to us , an official said . . . The NIA team will examine the data in the mobile phones seized from the suspects . The call records will be retrieved to ascertain if they had links in other States . . . It is learnt that the West Bengal Police collected more physical evidence from the blast site on Friday . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- on Tuesday summoned three persons from Chennai for interrogation in the LOC_Event blast case , after phone records revealed that they were in touch with the accused . . . At this stage , there is no concrete evidence to suggest their involvement . However , since their names have cropped up during the preliminary investigations , they have to be examined , an official said . . . Based on the phone records , the NIA found that the accused had links in almost all major cities , including those in Tamil Nadu and Kerala , he said . . . The NIA conducted searches in different parts of West Bengal on further leads in the case , allegedly involving members of Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen , a Bangladesh-based extremist group . . . The agency also collected evidence from the Beldanga accommodation of Shakil Ahmed , who was killed in the October 2 blast . Certain documents and metal pieces used in the making of the improvised explosive devices have been recovered , said an official of the Union Home Ministry . . . The NIA team and the West Bengal CID have also launched a search of the Simulia Madrassa , where the accused had been radicalised and initiated into terror activities . . . The NIA has already taken custody of three of the 12 accused , and is trying to secure the custody of the others for joint interrogation with the West Bengal CID and intelligence sleuths . . . Phone records reveal that they were in touch with the LOC_Event blast accused . . Phone records reveal they were in touch with the Bardhaman blast accused . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- on Thursday seized a sack containing about 40 improvised explosive devices from the house of a suspect wanted in connection with the LOC_Event blast on October 2 . . . The NIA officers are being assisted by the National Security Guard team in safe disposal of the devices , as the house is located in a thickly-populated area , said a senior NIA official . A hunt has been launched for the suspect , who went missing after the blast . . . The suspects house , which has been cordoned off for gathering forensic evidence , is located close to the building where the explosion took place , killing two alleged members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh . . . On Wednesday , the NIA had searched the residence and shop belonging to the accused , Hashem Moulla , in LOC_Event , lifted swabs of explosive traces from a vehicle belonging to the owner of the house where the blast took place and seized a laptop . The agency also summoned another suspect from LOC_Event and seized a computer from a shop there . . . According to agency sources , the Jamaat extremists involved in the case were part of a larger conspiracy to destabilise the incumbent Sheikh Hasina-led Bangladesh government . Some of the arrested persons have turned out to be from Bangladesh . One of those killed in the October 2 blast -LSB- Subhan -RSB- was also a Bangladeshi national , said an officer . Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday the Trinamool Congress government would extend full cooperation to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- probing the LOC_Event case . Addressing a press conference here , she lashed out at the Bharartiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- - led government at the Centre for not consulting the State Government before initiating the NIA probe . . . She said : If something has happened , it should be looked into seriously . A crime is crime . All criminals are the same . . . Ms. Banerjee also said that crime should not be linked to any religion . Their -LRB- criminals -RRB- only religion is extremism . We never support it and never will , she said . . . Refuting BJPs allegation that the AITC government is going soft on infiltration from Bangladesh , Ms. Banerjee said infiltration is a Central subject and pointed out that the State police do not guard the borders . . . Praising the LOC_Event police for its performance in probing the LOC_Event blast case , she said : Even before they -LRB- Centre -RRB- said anything , the LOC_Event police slapped the accused with UAPA -LRB- Unlawful Activities Prevention Act -RRB- . . . Rubbishing the Oppositions allegation that the LOC_Event police were not cooperating with the NIA , she claimed that even the Central investigative agency has acknowledged total cooperation on part of the LOC_Event police . She accused the media of distorting her post on a social networking site soon after the Centre initiated the NIA probe into the case . : The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- probing the Oct. 2 LOC_Event blast said on Friday that the accused and their associates belong to the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen -LRB- JuM -RRB- Bangladesh , a terror organisation proscribed there . . . The NIA might announce cash rewards for information on those absconding . . . Two persons died in the blast . Four persons , including two women , are under the custody of the NIA . . . Kausar and Rezaul Karim , from whose house a cache of improvised explosives was recovered days after the blast , are still at large . On the eve of his visit to LOC_Event in West Bengal , where two suspected members of Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- were killed in the October 2 bomb blast , National Security Adviser Ajit Doval said there appeared to be a large network of the banned group that the investigators were working to unravel . . . Mr. Doval told The Hindu that both Indian and Bangladeshi governments were working in close coordination in the fight against terrorism . Both the countries enjoy excellent bilateral relations and we have been working together , he said . . . The NSA said the case had serious implications and required a comprehensive investigation . Special Secretary -LRB- Internal Security -RRB- Prakash Mishra and representatives of the Research and Analysis Wing , the Intelligence Bureau and the National Investigation Agency may accompany the NSA to West Bengal . NIA Director-General Sharad Kumar had earlier visited LOC_Event and Murshidabad on October 24 . : Stressing that the Centre has taken the accidental blast at LOC_Event very seriously , senior officials of the Union Home Ministry including National Security Adviser -LRB- NSA -RRB- Ajit Doval met LOC_Event Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the State Secretariat here on Monday . . . After a two-hour meeting with the Chief Minister and senior officials , Prakash Mishra , Special Secretary -LRB- Internal Security -RRB- at the Union Home Ministry said the Centre and LOC_Event are together in fighting terror . . . The visit of senior Home Ministry officials is crucial as the Trinamool Congress had initially opposed the probe by National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- . Recently Ms. Banerjee had expressed displeasure that the Centre had not taken her into confidence while ordering the probe . . . I am very happy to say that the Chief Minister has given an assurance that the Centre and State will work together in unearthing the entire case , Mr. Mishra told journalists . . . Mr. Mishra also added that the Home Ministry will work on improving the capacity of State police and central forces engaged in this operation so that the investigation reaches its logical end . Kolkata : The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has come under fire for alleged involvement in anti-national activities after an explosion killed two people in LOC_Event on Thursday . The CPM and the BJP say the police destroyed evidence before the National Investigation Team -LRB- NIA -RRB- could reach the spot.The building where the blast took place - located in LOC_Event area - is owned by a former state government employee who is allegedly a Trinamool supporter . Some Trinamool flags were found stacked in one of the rooms on the ground floor . At one time , the Trinamool had also allegedly used a room in the house as an office . `` A bomb blast took place inside the home of a TMC leader . In that house people of Indian Mujahideen were living . Some substance exploded and after which it was told that NIA should be informed . But NIA was informed 24 hours later . The material which could have been used as the evidence was destroyed in river ... Mamata Banerjee should tell that if that home belongs to a TMC leader or not ? Why did your SP of LOC_Event destroy the evidence ? '' BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh asked in Delhi . CPM leader Sitaram Yechuri said , `` The track record of state police in recent years does not augur well . Central government should interfere and act against the guilty . `` The Trinamool , denying any links with the blast , claimed the BJP and CPM were conspiring to disturb peace in the state at a sensitive time - the end of the Durga Pujas and the eve of Eid . `` The comments by Biman Bose and the BJP are totally insensitive . The timing too is devious , especially at this juncture when Durga idols are still being immersed and the holy festival of Eid is to be held tomorrow , '' said Mukul Roy , Trinamool General Secretary.The owner of the house where the blast occurred has been detained for questioning . Two women who lived as tenants there have been arrested . Meanwhile , in Kolkata this evening , principal secretary , home , Basudeb Banerjee , denied any RDX or Al Qaeda posters had been found at the blast site . He also denied reports about lack of cooperation between the state police and central agencies investigating the incident . . Burdwan : An unpainted two-storey house with a pink window on the first floor - that was the scene of the blast in West Bengal 's LOC_Event on Thursday in which two suspected militants were killed and a third injured.Alima and Rumi , the wives of one of the injured and one of the dead , have been arrested . When they moved into the first floor flat at LOC_Event 's Khargagarh area four months ago , they apparently told the landlord they were in the burqa-making business . But what they allegedly made here instead , were bombs.A narrow grilled doorway is the only way up to the first floor . When police and firemen rushed here after the blast , the two women allegedly barred them from entering the flat where the explosion had occurred and used the time to allegedly burn incriminating material , including pamphlets that mentioned Al Qaeda chief Ayman al Zawahari and the words `` Mujahedeen '' and `` Chechen Rebels '' . Almost overshadowing investigations is the political row between the Trinamool and the CPM and the BJP over the incident . The opposition parties want the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- to probe the blast and not the state police . They allege there are links between the ruling party and the people behind the blast.These allegations have emerged from the fact that a Trinamool supporter owns the building , and Trinamool flags were found inside a room on the ground floor . The Trinamool denies any links . Party MP Mukul Roy says there was no Trinamool office in the building . However , local party leaders have said on record that they used the ground floor room during elections.Police suspect a Bangladeshi link and that the suspected terrorists may have had connections with militant groups across the border.A lot of answers could come from the two women arrested and under interrogations . But , according to reports , the women are not giving anything away . One of the women reportedly told her interrogators that she could kill people . . The building where the blast took place is located in LOC_Event area.Kolkata : After three arrests and two raids over last week 's blast in LOC_Event , the West Bengal police feel it could involve a terror network - giving teeth to opposition demands to involve the National Investigation agency or the Central Bureau of Investigation . On Wednesday , the case , which had been filed under the Explosives Act , was also brought under Unlawful Activities -LRB- Prevention -RRB- Act - a law that 's applied in cases where the integrity and sovereignty of the country is threatened . The new charge was brought in hours after the police raided two houses in LOC_Event , making official the suspicion that the two men , who died in the October 2 blast at the house in LOC_Event , could have been terrorists . -LRB- LOC_Event Blast : Burqa Factory Front for Bomb-Making Plant ? -RRB- There had been other evidence - improvised explosive devices and material to make them , watch dials and detonators recovered from the house . Some printed material was also found , which had references to Al Qaeda , Indian Mujahideen and even the Chechen rebels.On October 5 , two women residents of the house were arrested . One of them was the wife of Shakil Ahmed , a man who died in the blast . Another 's husband , Abdul Hasan , had been injured . A third - a man - was arrested later . Their questioning led to the raids in two houses -- one at Baburbag , the other at Badshahi Road - barely a kilometer from the blast site . -LRB- LOC_Event Blasts : Two Women Arrested , Bengal Becoming Terror Haven , says BJP -RRB- The police were looking for a man called called Kausar , but he had had fled . Kauser , who was probably a Bangladeshi national , used to visit Shakil Ahmed . Police suspect he collected bombs from Shakil for delivery to unknown recipients . At the house , police found a driving license , four pistols and 63 bullets.The six residents of the other house have gone missing as well . Following the raids , the police added the UAPA to the case . The opposition , which had accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of involvement and alleged that the police destroyed evidence , has now stepped up its demands to call in the NIA . -LRB- LOC_Event Blast : 2 Women Arrested , Trinamool Denies Links -RRB- `` The incident is linked to Bangladesh and who knows which other countries . That 's why it should be probed by the CBI or NIA , '' said BJP leader Rahul Sinha . The CPM 's SK Mishra echoed it , saying , `` If they -LRB- state police and CID -RRB- are not afraid they will be caught red-handed for hiding something , they should hand it over to NIA . '' . The building where the blast took place is located in LOC_Event area.New Delhi/Kolkata : The National Investigation Agency has registered a First Information Report in the bomb blast case in LOC_Event in West Bengal , after the Centre on Thursday decided to hand over the probe to the agency , a decision which sources in the Trinamool Congress government said was taken suo motu.The decision to hand over the case to the NIA was taken by the Centre in view of international ramifications of the case where some nationals from neighbouring Bangladesh were also allegedly involved , official sources said in Delhi.A notification was issued under the NIA Act and the agency will be registering an FIR on Friday , sources said . `` We have informed the Centre about the incident and no opinion has been given from the state government side , '' a highly-placed state government source said in Kolkata . `` The Centre has the powers to initiate a suo motu probe in this regard and this is what the Ministry of Home Affairs has done , '' the source said . `` The state government has the copy of the MHA order dated today which clearly says that NIA has taken up the matter to probe suo motu , '' the source added.The BJP and CPI -LRB- M -RRB- while demanding that the Centre hand over the case to NIA has alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government was trying to hush up the matter . The BJP also accused the state government of `` resisting '' a NIA probe.The Union Home Ministry had received reports from central agencies and the state government about the October 2 blast in which two suspected militants - Shakil Ahmed and Sovan Mandal - were killed and another man Hasan Saheb was injured.The state government , which appeared to be initially reluctant to accept that the incident in LOC_Event had suspected terror links , handed over the case to the state CID after material collected from the blast site showed that a group was assembling bombs in the house and planning to carry out a strike.A large number of watch dials , SIM cards and other tools required to make improvised explosive devices were seized from the house where the blast occurred.Four persons , including two women , have been arrested so far in the case . .

Burdwan : The Central investigators probing the October 2 blast in West Bengal 's Burdwan , found at least 30 hand grenades in the toilet of a house near the site - one that was searched and sealed by the state police eight days ago.The Bengal police had raided the house - on Badshahi Road - on October 8 after questioning the two women arrested from the house in LOC_Event , where the blast took place . The house was vacant at the time of the raid - half-a-dozen men living there who claimed to be masons , had decamped . Among those absconding is one Rezaul , suspected to be a key Jihadi element . But today , the sniffer dogs of the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- and the National Security Guards -LRB- NSG -RRB- found the bombs - bolstering the Opposition claims that the state police are hiding evidence at the behest of the ruling Trinamool Congress.The BJP 's Siddharth Nath Singh , in fact , had 10 questions for the Mamata Banerjee government , including one regarding the `` conspiracy '' that `` forced her government to allow evidence at LOC_Event to be destroyed . `` The Trinamool snapped back , asking what Mr Singh 's locus standi was anyway . Ms Banerjee was in Jhargram , where she did not refer to the LOC_Event blast except to call for communal harmony . `` We should all live in peace but there are some mischievous people who do n't want that , '' she said.Earlier today , the NIA-NSG teams combed a madrasa at Simulia with bomb detectors . They also detained two relatives of the absconding principal Yusuf Sheikh.During its probe that began on Sunday , the NIA had found material suggesting the madrasa may have been used as a hub by jihadi elements linked to the LOC_Event blast . Air gun pellets , sharp-edged weapons , money receipts and jihadi literature - including a Bengali book titled , `` How To Die A Good Death '' - were found , said sources . . The bombs were detonated today on a sandy stretch a little away from LOC_Event town.Burdwan : The West Bengal police 's handling of the initial investigation into the October 2 blast in LOC_Event might have allowed at least three dozen people possibly connected with the explosion that killed two people , to escape to Bangladesh , say sources in the National Investigation Agency or NIA , which now has charge of the investigation . -LRB- LOC_Event Blast Case : 30 Grenades Found From House Sealed by Bengal Police -RRB- The sources said the local police had failed to make much headway in the case even after the arrest of three prime suspects in the case . This despite the fact that the Bengal police had also recovered a pen drive from a house in the area , that had a recording of an instructor explaining in Urdu and Bangla how to make bombs , improvised explosive devices and hand grenades . -LRB- LOC_Event Blast : National Investigation Agency Team Visits Madrasa -RRB- The pen drive has now been handed over to the NIA , which has , since it began its investigation on Sunday , also reportedly found material suggesting that an abandoned madrasa may have been used as a hub by people linked to the LOC_Event blast to make bombs that were exported to Bangladesh . On Thursday , the NIA found more than 30 IEDs in the toilet of a house near the blast site - one that was searched and sealed by the state police eight days ago . The Bengal police had raided the house on October 8 after questioning the two women arrested in the case and found it vacant . -LRB- National Investigation Agency Files Complaint in LOC_Event Blast Case -RRB- But yesterday , sniffer dogs of the NIA and the elite National Security Guards or NSG found the bombs , which were detonated today on a sandy stretch a little away from LOC_Event town . The NIA reportedly estimates that about 36 people allegedly associated with the manufacturing of bombs and hand grenades should have been in apprehended , among them terror masterminds . But the local police did not even raid the madarsa , which came under the scanner after the two women arrested for the LOC_Event blast allegedly admitted their links with it . The opposition in the state , including the BJP that rules at the Centre , has alleged that the state police are hiding evidence at the behest of the ruling Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress , which had vehemently opposed handing the case over to the NIA . The Trinamool has lashed back , saying the party has full confidence in the state police . In a recent Facebook post , Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not mention the LOC_Event blast directly or the deployment of NIA , but accused the Centre of violating the federal structure of the country . -LRB- BJP 's Arrogance , Conduct Reminiscent of Emergency Days : Mamata Banerjee -RRB- . The building in LOC_Event where an explosion occurred on October 2Kolkata : The blast in West Bengal 's LOC_Event district has raised a question in intelligence circles . Is there a joint venture between Bangladeshi and Indian terror outfits ? Most experts say the answer is a resounding yes . If the external outfit is the Jamaat-e-Mujahideen Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- , what are some of the Indian groups linked to it , groups which have helped JMB set up its network and bomb-making units in Bengal ? Shakil Ahmed aka Shakil Gazi , the man who died in the LOC_Event blast on October 2 , is believed to be a Bangladeshi . Before setting up the bomb-making unit in LOC_Event , he used to live in Murshidabad district 's Beldanga with his wife and child , where he ran a burqa-making factory.Interrogation of his widow , who was arrested from the blast site , and intelligence inputs suggest he was a member of the JMB which entered into a joint venture with Indian terror groups to set up shop in Bengal . `` This was definitely a joint venture between at least two groups of terrorists , if not three , '' says Subir Bhaumik , a journalist who has been a long-time Bangladesh watcher . `` The JMB was definitely involved , from all evidence , This was actually something that was happening over a period of time . `` Manash Ghosh of the Statesman newspaper agreed as well . `` No doubt about it . It is absolutely sure . I hope our investigating agencies are able to unearth the nexus . On the ground , we can see it happening , '' said Mr Ghosh.Names of many Indian terror groups have surfaced in connection with the blasts , including the Indian Mujahideen , Al Jihad , Al Ummah and even SIMI.But why would JMB want to make bombs in Bengal for export to Bangladesh ? Dhaka watchers suggest that Shiekh Hasina made it impossible for the JMB to function in Bangladesh after is ban in 2005 . `` It was getting too hot for Jamaat to operate in Bangladesh , '' said Mr Ghosh . `` Many of their cadres were getting killed in crossfire , in encounters with rapid action battalions of Sheikh Hasina government . `` A probe by the National Investigation Agency is currently underway into the October 2 blast . . Burdwan : The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- has said that all four persons arrested in connection with the blast in West Bengal 's LOC_Event on October 2 are members of the terror group , Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- . The agency also said that the accused were preparing improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- for transporting them to Bangladesh for possible terror attacks . `` Investigation so far has revealed that the accused persons and their associates were the members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen , Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- , a terrorist organisation proscribed in Bangladesh and they were preparing IEDs which were being transported to Bangladesh , '' the NIA said in a statement on Friday.Two men , Shakil Ahmed and Suvon Mandal alias Subhan - both allegedly residents of Bangladesh - were killed while making the IEDs in a rented house in LOC_Event in LOC_Event .

He also visited another house at nearby Mathpara in LOC_Event where 39 IEDs were found on October 17 by the NIA ; 37 of them were detonated . The house , incidentally , had been searched and sealed by the state police eight days before the NIA recovered the IEDs . `` We have evolved strategies regarding arrests of absconding accused persons .

Two suspected Bangladeshi militants were killed in what appears to be an accidental blast in a rented house where bombs were being assembled . Four persons , including two women have been arrested ; one of them is the wife of a terror suspect who died in the blast.Sources say Mr Doval will urge Ms Banerjee to cooperate with central investigators .

LOC_Event is about 150 km north of Assam 's main city of Guwahati.Dhubri attackTwo police personnel have been killed and two injured in a blast in LOC_Event area of Dhubri district.with input from agencies . In all its 30 years as a militant organisation claiming to fight the state in the name of the people of LOC_Event , the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- has not once shown any serious inclination to push for a political solution . Instead , its commitment to a sovereign LOC_Event through armed struggle has invariably led it to pick soft targets , especially innocent civilians , in cowardly strike-and-flee terror operations across the north-eastern regions largest State . The spate of attacks during the run-up to the general election , which is scheduled for April 23 in LOC_Event , is in keeping with the groups virulent opposition to the democratic process . ULFA evidently has more faith in its fire power against soft targets than in the people it claims to represent . The bomb blasts of April 6 , which claimed 10 lives , were timed for the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to LOC_Event , and also Raising Day , which marks the founding of the chauvinist outfit on April 7 , 1979 . For some years now , ULFA has chosen Raising Day , along with Republic Day and Independence Day , for carrying out major operations . In recent months , the dates of VIP visits have fallen in the same category . . . With its limited support base and its terrorist skills , ULFA poses a challenge more on the security front than on the political . Belying its name , it has failed to win anything but fringe support among the people of a State that badly needs livelihood support , jobs , and development and looks to the central government for more substantial assistance . After the dialogue process reached a dead-end in 2007 , ULFA faced a revolt in its ranks for the simple reason that it had no programme other than mindless violence that was leading nowhere . Unfortunately , security agencies were not quick enough to take advantage of this internal weakness , in part because ULFA was using Bangladesh as a base for its hit-and-hide operations . With Sheikh Hasina coming to power , India has a friendly government to count on . It needs to deploy all its persuasive powers to have the terrorist group flushed out of its Bangladesh sanctuaries . At home , the security forces must devise a coordinated operation to eliminate ULFAs infrastructure . A pan-north-east campaign against violent extremism has become an imperative and for this inter-State coordination , better intelligence , and more efficient sharing of intelligence among central security and State police forces is vital . ULFA has pockets of activity in Nagaland , Meghalaya , and Arunachal Pradesh and these must be eliminated through coordinated action . Meanwhile , the best answer to ULFAs extremism will be ensuring a peaceful general election in LOC_Event . . . Corrections and Clarifications . . In General Elections 2009 , voting in LOC_Event is in two phases - on April 16and April 23 . The editorial ` Combating ULFA ' -LRB- April 9 , 2009 -RRB- mentioned itas April 23 . GUWAHATI : Ten days before it goes to the polls and 24 hours before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to land in his home state , Assam was rocked by four deadly explosions on Monday that left at least nine people dead and more than 60 people injured . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Undeterred by the terror attacks , the prime minister will go ahead with his visit and address a rally at Dispur on Tuesday , officials in New Delhi said .

In the past , Ulfa terrorists have triggered blasts in the state to observe the day and also planted bombs just ahead of VVIP visits , the deadliest being serial blasts in January , just ahead of Chidamabaram 's first visit to Guwahati as home minister . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Monday 's deadliest blast was triggered at a busy bus stop at Maligaon on the outskirts of Guwahati around 1.40 pm and killed eight people , including a 10-year-old boy . More than 50 people were injured there . The Maligaon police station and the headquarters of the Northeast Frontier Railway are a stone 's throw from the site . According to a police officer scanning the site minutes after the blast , the explosion at Maligaon was caused by an improvised explosive device -LRB- IED -RRB- planted either on a bicycle or a motorcycle . People waiting at the bus stop were the first to be hit . The blast was so powerful that several cars and motorcycles parked nearby caught fire . The flames soon spread to neighbouring houses . Many people jumped out of their windows in panic to escape the fire and smoke and injured themselves . Less than two hours later , another explosion , this time at a busy marketplace in Dhekiajuli in Sonitpur district , injured three Railway Protection Force personnel on election duty . Here , too , the bomb was strapped to a parked bicycle , a vehicle of terror that has been used effectively by Ulfa terrorists . In the third blast in the evening , terrorists threw a grenade at the Mancachar police station in Dhubri district , killing a constable . Another grenade lobbed in the Garo Basti area in Udalguri district did not explode . A fourth bomb explosion rocked Karbi Anglong district , injuring two people . Gogoi condemned the blasts and said his government would crush the terrorist elements operating in the state . Deputy inspector general of police -LRB- central range -RRB- G P Singh said Ulfa was behind the blasts . ` We had information about the outfit 's plans to carry out terror activities ahead of its foundation day on April 7 , ' he said . Sources said intercepted messages of Ulfa militants suggest the outfit will now target security forces and non-Assamese people . ` The LOC_Event may have been carried out by one of Ulfa 's 109th battalion members who have recently sneaked into the city . We came to know about a 27th battalion Ulfa cadre named Deepak who had supposedly hired a man called Sagar Topno to carry out the blast in Sonitpur district , ' a source said . Forensic experts who visited the blast site at Maligaon said bicycle ball-bearings were packed into the bomb as shrapnel .

The NIA has already sent a request to Sri Lanka for examining Siddiqui , who is suspected to have tasked several modules to carry out a recce of vital installations in south India . The NIA had also named Siddiqui in an FIR last year following the arrest of Thameem Ansari , a resident of Tamil Nadu . . . Hussain , a resident of Kandy in Sri Lanka , was alleged to have been given the task of circulating counterfeit currency in Tamil Nadu . At the time of his arrest , he was reportedly carrying fake notes and other classified documents . . . Meanwhile , the political echoes of the blasts were soon heard in the state . State BJP president Pon Radhakrishnan alleged a plot against the partys prime ministerial candidate , Narendra Modi , linking the blasts to Modis campaign rallies in south Andhra Pradesh on Thursday . However , even if the train was running on time , it would have been near the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border , still some distance and time away from the campaign venues . . . DMK president M Karunanidhi said the blasts could have been prevented if the police had acted promptly after arresting Hussain . But Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa , who is in charge of the police department , is back in Kodanadu , said Karunanidhi . The CM has been at her Kodanadu Estate residence in the Nilgiris district since last Sunday . . . Other parties like the DMDK , PMK and MDMK also condemned the incident and alleged that the state government had failed to ensure the safety of the people . . . Jayalalithaa , who has ordered an inquiry by the Crime Branch CID , asked the people of Tamil Nadu not to panic and assured that the police were stepping up security across the state . She also deputed two ministers and senior officials to supervise the relief measures . Security has been beefed up across the state , especially at sensitive installations including airports , railway stations and major bus terminals . In Bangalore , Additional DGP M N Reddi said security has been beefed up in all railway stations in the state .

He then runs away and is not seen getting back on the train in the video captured by cameras at the station.The police are yet to make any arrests in connection with the low-intensity explosions which the Centre reportedly wants to treat as a terror attack . But its offer to the Jayalalithaa government for a probe by the elite National Investigation Agency was today turned down . -LRB- Jayalalithaa Says No to Central Probe Into LOC_Event Blasts -RRB- As per initial investigations , there is no evidence to suggest that the bombs in the train were planted in LOC_Event . The explosions happened nearly 10 minutes after the arrival of the train , which was already running late by 90 minutes . Cops also say that the blasts would have happened in Andhra Pradesh had the train been on schedule . There has been speculation that the blasts were originally timed to disrupt Narendra Modi 's rallies in coastal Andhra Pradesh . The Tamil Nadu police , however , have dismissed this theory . -LRB- Narendra Modi 's Security Stepped Up After LOC_Event Blasts -RRB- But they did say there were similarities between yesterday 's blasts and the ones in Patna in October last year ahead of Mr Modi 's rally . Six were killed and nearly 80 were injured in the explosions which were allegedly masterminded by terror group Indian Mujahideen.DMK chief M Karunanidhi , Ms Jayalalithaa 's staunch rival , has criticised the state government , alleging the blasts in LOC_Event `` could have been averted if the police had properly questioned the recently arrested alleged ISI operative Sakir Hussein .

As we file this column we have the news of twin blasts on the LOC_Event - LOC_Event this morning , within minutes of its arrival at Chennai Central railway station . One woman passenger - a TCS employee - was killed and several others injured . One person has been detained by the Tamil Nadu Police for questioning . . . Significantly , this incident comes just a few days after the arrest by the State Police of a suspected ISI operative . Interrogation of the two individuals in police custody could throw up some sensational facts on terrorist plans . We will have to await them rather than indulge in speculations , which may be wide of the mark . These developments are unfortunate if one considers the fact that , almost three weeks into the worlds biggest election , Indian security agencies have done an excellent job ensuring public safety , particularly countering terrorist threats . . . Spot of the blast on LOC_Event railway station . PTI . . The fact that there has been no major terrorist action in the country at a time when security forces are extremely stretched is undoubtedly a tribute to the administrations state of preparedness . There is however no room for complacence , as the LOC_Event train explosion reveals . This is the ideal time to reflect on the strategy and strength of the one most potent terrorist groups in the country that has often derived support from external foes , especially Pakistan . Our reference is to the Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) which has displayed some resilience despite setbacks in the form of arrests of a few of its leadership and reported differences within the hierarchy on future strategy . . . In September 2013 , the authors of this piece ( based on a computational model ) published predictions of IM attacks in the last quarter of 2013 . These predictions were proved accurate by the devastating attacks on an election rally in Patna featuring BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi . But a subsequent prediction by the authors in January 2014 forecasting attacks by IM during the January-May 2014 time frame has thus far been proven wrong although not for a lack of effort by IM to carry out attacks that disrupt the elections . Indians can be grateful for the extraordinary work by Indian security organizations in preventing IMs plots from being successful . . . In the last quarter of 2013 , Indian security officials were able to make several key arrests of IM operatives . In early November , following the attack on Modis election rally in Patna , several IM operatives were arrested . Additional operatives of IMs predecessor organization , the Students Islamic Movement of India as well as a few IM men were also arrested in December 2013 . A predictive behavioral model of IM attacks suggested that IM often carries out attacks on public sites ( usually markets ) a few months after arrests of some IM members . . . Moreover , in November 2013 , IM released video clips and imagery of the Babri Masjid demolition and the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat the goal of these releases may have been to inflame Indian Muslim sentiment or to encourage IM operatives . The behavioral model of IM found that , when IM engages in a publicity campaign , attacks follow a few months later . Attacks by IM also follow about half a year after any signs of improvements in Indo-Pak diplomatic relations . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in September 2013 . These data-points led our behavioral model to predict impending attacks in the January-May 2014 time frame . . . It is now clear that IM had carefully laid plans and took operational steps to carry out several such attacks during this time frame , proving the behavioral model correct . Indias security agencies carried out a series of arrests in March-April 2014 , breaking up several plots to attack a diverse set of targets . IM has reportedly targeted the Red Fort in Delhi , sending operatives to carry out physical surveillance . IM also had plans to carry out serial bombings in Jaipur and Pushkar targeting tourists , as well as the famous Rath Yatra festival in Puri . The Delhi Police Commission SM Srivastava is on record having described what was to come by way of planned IM attacks in the next few months . . . Opposition to Indias democracy has long been a fundamental tenet of IMs ideology . IM argues that Indias secular democracy can not protect Indias Muslims from the Hindu majority . An attack during the current election period has the potential to not only disrupt the free and fair conduct of the elections , but also to trigger an avalanche of communal violence . For IM , this would be a self-fulfilling prophecy , giving them further impetus to spread their radical message and expanding their appeal . While IM radicalism has had only miniscule appeal to Indias Muslim population , a well-organized and sponsored terrorist group requires only a relatively small cadre to spread enormous havoc . . . Thus , disrupting all potential terrorist plots has been a top priority for the Indian security establishment one that they have carried out spectacularly well . In just the past two months , at least five IM plots have reportedly been disrupted by Indian police , including highly symbolic operations against the Red Fort , specific operations against tourism-related targets , and specific operations against religious events . All of these had the potential to both exacerbate communal tensions as well as energize IMs cadres . . . The law enforcement success to date must not lead to complacency not only between now and the announcement of the election results but beyond . Weakened terrorist groups can be very dangerous , as they seek to rally their supporters ( and in the case of IM show their continued value to their sponsors ) with further attacks . With arrests of top leaders like Yasin Bhatkal ( IMs leader in India ) , Tehseen Akhtar , and Pakistani bomb-maker Waqas , who reportedly planned the Patna and LOC_Event attacks , their allies such as Lashkar-e-Taiba , and their Pakistani sponsors may strive to show that IM remains capable of executing deadly terror strikes . . . Reports of IMs intended targets are particularly worrisome . In the past , Rajasthan and Odisha have been ` hibernating grounds ' for IM militants , where IM has focused on building sleeper cells and engaged in recruitment and fund-raising activities , while generally carrying out relatively few attacks . If , as it appears , IM has chosen to activate their sleeper cells in these States , potentially jeopardizing their safe heavens , it is a sign that greater intelligence gathering and security sweeps are called for . . . Considering IMs powerful sponsors , it would be premature to assume that the organization has been de-fanged . Beyond maintaining their vigilance , Indian security forces should also continue to pursue the organizational reforms needed for effective counter-terrorism . Expanding intelligence capabilities to better collect , analyze , and disseminate intelligence is crucial . Improved intelligence cooperation between agencies at the federal and provincial levels is particularly important in connecting the dots to identify terrorist plots , and ensuring that local law enforcement officials have the information needed to prevent attacks . Indias security forces have had remarkable successes recently , but an enduring lesson of counter-terrorism is that effective terrorist organizations are learning organizations that adapt quickly . To continue keeping Indian citizens safe , the nations security services must do the same . . .

Twin blasts were reported at the LOC_Event central railway station on Thursday morning.One person has been reported killed and 12 others are injured , two critically.The deceased was identified as 22-year-old Swati from Guntur . . . Eyewitnesses said they heard two explosions on coaches S4 and S4 of the Bangalore-Guwahati Kaziranga express as it arrived at the LOC_Event railway station . . . The train arrived at 7.05 am and the explosions took place at 7.15 am.The train was on its way to Guwahati.One suspect who had been detained following the twin blasts may be released . . . The Railways has announced a solatium of Rs 1 lakh for the deceased and Rs 25,000 for seriously injured and Rs 5,000 for those who have sustained minor injuries . . The entire area is being sanitised.Intelligence Bureau officials have confirmed that the blasts at LOC_Event were an act of terror.Without naming any group , IB sources informed that going by the bomb composition and the manner in which they had been placed it was clear that the attack was aimed at killing more than one person and hence classifies as a terror act.The forensics team , meanwhile , has been able to ascertain some facts regarding the bomb . . . It is suspected that the bomb was triggered off by a mobile device.The nature of the injury sustained would indicate the presence of metal bombs packed into the bomb . . . The bomb was planted under the seat and hence the impact was borne by the seat . . . The train was originally supposed to reach LOC_Event at 5.30 am , but was delayed . . . The police say that if the intent was to cause an explosion then the accused could have done it anywhere . However , they waited for the train to arrive in LOC_Event to plant the bomb . . . No terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far , but several groups -- both political and religious -- are under the investigators ' scanner . No need for NIA here ; our cops will handle this : JayalalithaaThe Centre was forced to put on hold dispatch of teams of NIA , NSG and forensic experts to LOC_Event after the LOC_Event government spurned its help . . . LOC_Event , whose Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is strongly opposed to any interefernece from Central agencies on the subject of law and order , refused to take any help from the Centre , saying its police was well equipped to handle the blast probe . . . Following the stand taken by the LOC_Event government , the Home Ministry immediately put on hold sending teams of NIA , NSG and forensic experts to LOC_Event to help in the probe into the two blasts at LOC_Event railway station . . . Official sources said the Home Ministry had earlier directed the National Investigation Agency , National Security Guard and forensic experts to get ready to go to LOC_Event . . . While the NIA team was supposed to go from Hyderabad , the NSG and forensic experts were being readied in New Delhi . Jayalalithaa has meanwhile ordered a CB-CID probe and the state government conveyed to the Home Ministry that it was equipped to handle the investigation.Coincidence?Interestingly , the blasts come a day after the arrest of Zaheer Hussain , an agent of Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence who is a Sri Lankan national reporting to the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo.During interrogation , Hussain said he worked as a shoe exporter and visited LOC_Event several times to recruit and also plan blasts in Tamil Nadu.The police are expected to revisit his interrogation on Thursday.Image : A member of the bomb disposal squad examines the area next to the Bangalore-Guwahati Kaziranga express in which two explosions occurred.Photograph : Reuters .

The blasts happened at about 7.14 in S4 and S5 coaches , within five minutes of the train arriving here from Bengaluru . The impact caused some damage to S3 as well . . . The deceased , Swati , 24 , worked for software major TCS at Bengaluru and was on her way home at Guntur in Andhra Pradesh . Her grieving parents rushed here and took the body to the native place by a government ambulance . She was to be married in two months . The injured , including a woman , were admitted in the Rajiv Gandhi memorial government general hospital across the road . All of them are stable , according to the doctors . They said most of the injured had pellet wounds and two suffered multiple fractures on legs . ( Read : LOC_Event blast kills Andhra Pradesh techie ; 14 hurt ) . . Investigators recovered ball bearings and pellets , besides traces of ammonium nitrate , nitro toluene and sulphur from the blast sites . Preliminary investigation indicated that four men carrying two cloth bags had boarded S4 and S5 as soon as the train arrived . Surveillance cameras have captured the visuals of them coming out empty-handed . We strongly believe they had left those bags under the seats in the two coaches and triggered the blasts from outside . We are examining what their motives could have been , a senior police officer said , adding that three men have been detained for questioning . . .

THE CAR BOMB blast in LOC_Event on Thursday , wherein over 10 persons including a photo journalist were killed and twice that number injured , proclaims loud and clear that it is back to square one on the insurgency front in LOC_Event , what with the Hizbul Mujahideen also back in subversive business after a two-week ceasefire and a brief , even if palpably tentative , engagement with the Government of India in a ` peace ' process .

He had asserted that the security forces were ready to `` face the challenge and threat of renewed militancy '' and went on to claim that `` it is the militants who should worry '' .

The multi-pronged endeavour to frustrate the militants ' attempts to kill or otherwise strike terror should continue alongside the moves for finding a political solution through a constructive dialogue with various groups and interests concerned . By Our Special Correspondent NEW DELHI , AUG. . 11 . The Army is unlikely to launch fresh operations against Kashmiri militants following the withdrawal of the ceasefire by the Hizbul Mujahideen and Thursday 's bomb blast in Srinagar . Highly-placed Government sources said the Army had been told to keep its powder dry but refrain from operations which could impede the possible revival of the peace dialogue with the militants , especially the Hizbul Mujahideen . The Government is keen on engaging all the local Kashmir groups in talks , but will frontally take on the foreign - dominated Jehadi groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Harkatul Mujahideen .

In an interview to Jang , an Urdu daily , the Hizbul commander was quoted as saying : `` We will resort to heavy shelling in the next couple of days ... as has not been done in the last 10 years . India would have to pay a heavy price for rejecting the ceasefire offer . '' Asserting that any dialogue with India on the Kashmir issue would not be acceptable without the involvement of Pakistan , Syed Salahuddin said his organisation decided to go for a ceasefire in response to requests from diplomats of several countries including the United States . He claimed that diplomats of western countries urged the Hizbul to extend the deadline , but his organisation decided against it in view of the `` rigid stand of India '' . He has been quoted as saying that India can not now blame the Pakistani intelligence agency , Inter-Services Intelligence , for terrorist activities in Kashmir as India had admitted after the ceasefire announcement that 90 per cent of the attacks are carried out by the Hizbul cadres . In response to a question on the nature of help the Pakistan Army could extend to those engaged in fighting in Kashmir , he has been quoted as saying : `` What help can the Pakistan Army give us ? We have seen the results in the past . Had the Pakistan leadership taken timely action , the issue would have been resolved earlier .

Security experts are still at a loss to figure out why such a large amount of explosives were placed in the car .

One person , identified as R.P.Sood , a civilian working in the Army canteen , suffered minor injuries . . . `` The blast was of very low intensity and no shrapnels were found . The explosive simply spread around the area leading to superficial injuries to a worker in the canteen , '' said the Deputy Commissioner of Police -LRB- New Delhi -RRB- , Mr. R. S.

While there is no clue yet of the culprit in the first case , the police claimed to have solved the Connaught Place case by arresting an alleged ISI agent . New Delhi , May 9 A week after a crude bomb was discovered in the famous Palika Bazar , two bombs exploded near LOC_Event in the heart of the Capital today , injuring a 56-year-old man . . . Mr R.P. Singh , who sustained splinter injuries in his chest and mouth , is recuperating in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital . . . The first explosion occurred at 3.07 p.m. at the parking lot of the LOC_Event , opposite LOC_Event . The second explosion took place at 3.14 p.m. in a garbage dumped under a neem tree near gate number two of the LOC_Event , just behind the Prime Ministers Office . . . The first bomb is supposed to have been kept on the carrier of a cycle at the LOC_Event . The cycle and a Hero Honda motor cycle were damaged . As the bombs exploded there was panic among the passersby and employees in various government offices located in the area . Top police officials and forensic experts reached the spot and the entire area was cordoned off . . . The investigators at the spot also recovered two timer devices , one nine volt battery and a detonator wire and lifted samples of the remnants . . . The security personnel detained a person from near the spot immediately after the blast and whisked him away . However , he looked like a Kashmiri . . . Anti-sabotage squads also sanitised the area to make sure that there was no other bomb planted in the high-security area . . . Mr R.P. Singh , an employee in the LOC_Event sustained injuries as he was standing near the cycle on which the bomb was apparently kept . The Joint Commissioner of Police ( LOC_Event Range ) , Mr Suresh Roy , said the blasts were of low intensity and were triggered with crude bombs similar to the one recovered from North Block on April 10 . . . While not ruling out the involvement of militants in todays bomb explosion , Mr Roy said : It is too early to name the militant group involved in the twin blasts . . . It may be recalled that soon after the January 21 Red Fort shoot-out incident the Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Toiba militant outfit had made an open threat to strike at vital installations in the Capital , including the Prime Ministers Office . . . Even as the Special Cell in tandem with the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police began a probe into the blasts , senior police officials expressed apprehensions that the anti-national elements could trigger more blasts in the Capital . . . An eye witness , Mr Kishan Arora , who is working in Sena Bhavan , said when the bomb exploded only one person was standing near the cycle . He fell down just after the blast . Though the explosion was not of high intensity we thought that there was something wrong . The next moment we saw the person standing near the cycle , lying on the ground . . . He said it is very difficult to find out the culprit as it is a public place . . . An Army official said only traffic is managed by the Army in this area . It is not responsible for the security . The Delhi Police is responsible for the security in the area . By Our Staff Reporter NEW DELHI , AUG. 12 . The Delhi police are on the look out for three young men , suspected to be behind the crude bomb blast at LOC_Event in South Delhi late on Saturday night . Two persons sustained minor injuries and two autorickshaws and a car were damaged in the explosion . Investigations have revealed that the three had boarded an autorickshaw driven by Manager Rai from Sarai Kale Khan and were bound for Sagarpur in South-West Delhi . Teams have been sent to Sagarpur and other places to trace them . A thorough check of hospitals and nursing homes is also being carried out to see if any person with explosion-related injuries has been admitted . While the exact sequence of events is still not clear , police believe that the explosive material , which was apparently being carried by one of the three , either fell accidentally or was dropped from the autorickshaw following which the explosion occurred . Police have for the time being ruled out the involvement of any militant organisation . `` The time and choice of place and the explosive material used do not point towards a conspiracy to create a major disturbance , '' a senior police officer said . Preliminary investigations into the type of material used have suggested the use of low grade explosives . `` Only nails and other shrapnel have been found , '' the police officer added . Meanwhile , the South Delhi police are zeroing on two possibilities . `` The explosion could be the result of the retaliation from the Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- after one of their functionary was arrested in a joint operation in the Capital recently , '' a district police officer said . Another possibility is that the miscreants might have decided to get rid of the explosive substance to evade detection . `` In view of the stringent security measures taken for Independence Day , they must have found it difficult to take the explosive material all the way to Sagarpur . So they dumped it at LOC_Event , '' the officer said . However , police are not ruling out the possibility of the explosive being used to manufacture a more lethal bomb to cause a embarrassment to the police in the run up to the Independence Day celebrations . Following the blast , senior police officers rushed to the spot and took stock of the situation . Only on Saturday , Delhi police had announced that there were threats from militant organisations , which also included `` fidayeen '' attacks by teams comprising women . Meanwhile , security in the Capital has been beefed up following the blast . Senior district police officials are patrolling the sensitive areas in the districts and conducting surprise checks at various places . The police presence in the district has also been increased .

Police have picked up 25 persons for questioning in connection with the bomb blasts in the LOC_Event and LOC_Event bus stations both in the tribal-dominated Panchamahals district of central Gujarat in the last two days . . . A senior police official of the district , however , did not see any ` definite pattern ' in the bomb explosions and believed these to be acts of local anti-social elements trying to create panic . The bombs were crude ones not requiring expert handling . The official also disagreed that the blasts could have any links with the LOC_Event train carnage of February 27 as the time gap between the two was large . . . While the bomb that exploded at the LOC_Event on Tuesday last was planted in a bus , at LOC_Event , the explosion was on the platform and most of the injured were those who queued up in front of the drinking water pub . . . In the wake of the explosions , the State Transport Corporation is strengthening security in and around bus stations , particularly in the Panchamahals district . The crew have also been issued strict instructions not to stop the buses at any point other than specified platforms and maintain vigil on the movement of suspicious passengers . Ahmedabad , Oct. 16 : Godhra has put Gujarat back on the edge after two bombs went off within a span of 28 hours in the town that witnessed the train carnage and at a bus terminus nearby . . . At least eight persons were injured when a bomb exploded at the bus station at LOC_Event , 35 km from LOC_Event , this evening . The blast came a day after six persons were injured in an explosion on a bus at the LOC_Event . . . Panchmahal ( the district where LOC_Event is located ) superintendent of police Narsimha Kumar said there was a marked similarity between the two explosions . . .

Almost all the passengers had alighted when the bomb went off , ripping out seats at the back , shattering window panes and damaging a tyre . . . Four persons standing beside the bus were hit by splinters . The condition of one of the injured , whose leg had to be amputated , is stated to be critical . At least six persons were injured in bomb blasts in LOC_Event and LOC_Event this evening . Police said four persons were severely injured when a powerful bomb went off in a State road transport bus at the LOC_Event terminus this evening . The bomb exploded soon after the bus , coming from a nearby village , was parked at the terminus . Four persons standing nearby were hit by splinters . The condition of three of the injured is stated to be critical . . . Police said the blast could have caused more casualties if the bomb had gone off 30 minutes later , when thousands of people were expected to assemble in the adjacent ground for the ` Ravan-dahan '' celebrations on Dussehra . . . In LOC_Event , two persons were injured in a blast while scraps were being loaded in a truck at a scrap market in the LOC_Event locality . The bomb apparently came with the scrap materials , but police could not say if it was planted intentionally . Both the injured have been declared out of danger . . .

The Mumbai Police on Friday claimed to have cracked the August 25 , 2003 twin blasts case with the arrest of four persons . The arrested include three persons from one family -- Syed Mohammad Hanif , 42 ; his wife Syed Fahmida Mohammand Hanif , 36 ; and daughter Syed Farheen Mohammad Hanif , 18 . . . . . These three , along with Hanif 's three-year-old daughter , had hired the taxi that was blown up at the Gateway of India . Complete coverage of the LOC_Event blastsThe police have handed over the three-year-old daughter to her grandmother . It was the description provided bythe taxi driver , who survived the blast , that helped the police find the suspects . The taxi driver , Shivnarayan Pande , is now being provided police protection . . . . . The fourth arrested , Arshad Shafique Mohammad Ansari , 27 , had hired the second taxi that blew up at LOC_Event , killing the driver . . . . . The police are still on the lookout for two more suspects and are confident of picking them up soon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Also Read . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Four arrested in LOC_Event blasts case'Police intelligence in LOC_Event is very poor '' The sound of the bomb still haunts me '45 minutes before the blasts , a warning ` There was no intelligence failure ' . . Incidentally , this outfit , which the police have termed as the Hanif group , was also responsible for the bomb blast at Ghatkopar on July 28 , 2003 , when a bomb was placed below the back seat of a bus , route number 340 . Then , the police said , Arshad and Farheen had boarded the bus and placed the bomb below the seat . . . . . . . This same outfit had also attempted to carry out a blast at SEEPZ -LRB- Santa Cruz Electronics Export Processing Zone -RRB- last year , but the explosive device failed . . . . . With the arrests , the police are clearly heaving a sigh of relief and are proud of having cracked the case in a week 's time . The media turned up in huge numbers when the police called the press conference , held in the office of LOC_Event Police Commissioner R S Sharma . Displayed on his huge table were gelatin sticks , alarm clocks , binding tape andshrapnel , all used by the Hanif group to make their bombs . . . . . LOC_Event Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal announced the arrests of the four suspects , and praised the police Crime Branch for their success . Crime Branch Unit 11 and Unit 9 were mainly responsible for cracking the case . . . . . Said a senior police officer , ` We arrested them a couple of days ago , but we made sure that they were the right people before calling this press conference , ' he said , and added testily , ` Otherwise , the media will be the first to castigate us . ' . . . . Asked if it did not amount to intelligence failure that this group was not arrested after the Ghatkopar blast , he said the reason was that after Ghatkopar , there was just no description of the couple who had boarded the bus . ` The police also need some clues when looking for people . This time , we were lucky to get a good description from the taxi driver and our men did the rest of the work , ' he said . . . . . THE arrests and interrogation of the four culprits has thrown light and revealed the politicised statements made earlier . The four arrested have no connection with any local outfit . When specifically asked whether SIMI -LRB- Students Muslim Organization of India -RRB- was involved , Bhujbal said , ` No . ' Then he added , ` So far . ' . . . . But while the involvement of local jihadi groups is being ruled out , the police were categorical in bringing to light the international links . They pointed out that Hanif , who is clearly the mastermind and key agent of the blast , was employed at the Hilton Hotel in Dubai as an electrician . . . . . The police said that after the Gujarat riots , he was ` indoctrinated ' in Dubai and returned to LOC_Event on September 14 , 2002 , with the intention of carrying out terrorist acts . On his return to LOC_Event , Hanif contacted Ashraf and the duo began carrying out the explosions , supported by Hanif 's wife and grown-up daughter . . . . . When asked who indoctrinated him , the police were unwilling to give a name or even a hint . But the aforementioned officer said that as per their information , they believe that the Dubai centre that ` indoctrinated ' Hanif received instructions from an outfit in Saudi Arabia , which in turn was commanded by an outfit in Pakistan . . . . . This officer said the involvement of the Lashkar-e-Tayiba was not ruled out , just that it was more roundabout . . . . . But what stands punctured is the so-called link between the Lashkar and SIMI , a link that had political overtones . . . . . ASHRAF told the police that they had formed the Gujarat Muslim Revenge Force to avenge the killings of Muslim during the Gujarat riots of early 2002 . Ashraf is a zari -LRB- embroidery -RRB- worker , based in Surat , southern Gujarat . . . . . But while the Gujarat riots affected Ahmedabad , Vadodara and central Gujarat , Surat was peaceful . So on what basis did Ashraf claim to be affected ? . . . . A second senior officer told rediff.com that when Ashraf was questioned why LOC_Event is being targeted if the motive is revenge for Gujarat , he apparently replied , ` Because the rich supporters of the Gujarat government are all based in LOC_Event . ' . . . . But a third senior police officer said in the final analysis , Gujarat was merely the fig leaf cover . ` Gujarat today is being blamed for everything , ' he said , ` It is too simple to assume that the only motive is Gujarat . It is like saying that if Gujarat did not happen then these blasts would not take place . But we know that would not be the case . These blasts are going to occur because the motive is far bigger . ' . . . . There has been the perception that the Gujarat revenge motive is being played to the hilt . When the blast occurred , Bhujbal 's first reaction then was to blame the blasts on Gujarat . Reason : all the blasts had occurred in Gujarati-dominated areas such as Ghatkopar and LOC_Event . The LOC_Event is an international symbol and a favourite tourist spot . . . . . But as the police revealed , the explosive for the LOC_Event blast was placed inside the bus at Andheri East , from where the bus begins its run , and timed to explode later . It was just a coincidence that it happened to be LOC_Event . And LOC_Event is one of LOC_Event 's most important commercial areas , and an extremely congested and busy area , where it is easy to slip in and out without anyone noticing . . . . . The police also said that the explosives were prepared at the residences of Hanif in Andheri West -LRB- northwestern LOC_Event -RRB- and Ashraf in Andheri East -LRB- northwestern LOC_Event -RRB- . The two , who lived in poor tenements , made the explosives from gelatin sticks that are available locally since gelatin is used for quarrying and other controlled blasts . . . . . There is as yet no indication that RDX was used . . . . . Asked about the use of RDX , Joint Commissioner of Police Dr Satyapal Singh said the police are still awaiting the report from the Central Forensic Laboratory of India , Chandigarh , and which would be considered final . . . . . The police said that Hanif originally hails from the Mangalore region -LRB- southwestern LOC_Event -RRB- while Arshad hails from the Bars Bareily district in Uttar Pradesh . . The Bombay High Court has upheld the death sentence awarded to three convicted LeT terrorists in the 2003 twin LOC_Event blasts , which left 54 dead and over 180 injured . . . Upholding the Pota court 's 2009 order , the HC dismissed the appeals of the accused . . . In a first , a married couple has been awarded the death sentence in a terror case . . . Hanif Syed ( 49 ) and his wife Fehmida Syed ( 46 ) were handed out the death sentence by the special Pota court in 2009 . . . The couple was found guilty of planting two highintensity bombs in crowded locations in Mumbai in August 2003 . . . Another accomplice , Ashrat Ansari ( 35 ) , has also been given the death sentence . . . The trio , along with fourth accused Nasir , had executed the bomb blast at the LOC_Event and LOC_Event in Mumbai on August 25 , 2003 . Nasir was shot by the police in an encounter later . . . The prosecution had said the LeT had used a family to carry out the attack in order to avenge the `` atrocities '' inflicted on Muslim families in the 2002 Godhra riots . . . The Bombay High Court upheld the death sentences of three terrorists including married couple Fehmida ( pictured left ) and Hanif Syed ( pictured right ) . . The trio was charged under the IPC , Explosive Substances Act and the stringent Pota for its role in the conspiracy and the bomb blasts . . . The Pota court also held them guilty for the July 2003 blast in a BEST bus in LOC_Event , which claimed two lives . . . The prosecution had also alleged that the trio had planted another bomb on a bus in the LOC_Event area in Jogeshwari on December 2 , 2002 . However , the bomb did not explode . . . The trial saw 103 witnesses being examined . . . Another accused turned approver during the trial and two others , Mohammed Ansari Ladoowala and Mohammed Hasan Batterywala , were discharged . . . The judgment was long awaited as the division bench of justices A.M. Khanwilkar and P.D. Kode had reserved the verdict on November 12 , 2011 . . . Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikkam , who argued the case for the government , expressed his happiness at the verdict . . . ` It is a significant judgment . It might take some more legal procedures before the death sentence is executed . . . ` However , we are confident that the execution will happen in due course , which should be soon , ' he added . . . The first bomb went off at the iconic Gateway of India ( pictured ) . . The second blast went off on a bus at LOC_Event in Mumbai . . On August 25 , 2003 , the three accused - along with the two daughters of Hanif - hired a taxi and reached the Gateway of India with RDX . . . They left the bag in the taxi and told the cab driver that they would return after lunch . . . From there , they hired another taxi and reached LOC_Event , the site where the second bomb went off minutes after the blast at the Gateway of India . . . The trio was arrested on August 31 , 2003 , under Pota regulations . A special Prevention of Terrorism Act -LRB- POTA -RRB- court has awarded the death sentence to all three accused in the 2003 twin Mumbai blasts at LOC_Event and LOC_Event . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Mohammad Hanif Syed , his wife Fehmida and third conspirator Ashrat Ansari were convicted for planting the bombs on August 25 , 2003 that left 54 dead and 244 injured . They had also planted a bomb on July 28 , 2003 in a municipal bus in suburban Ghatkopar which killed two persons . The judge P R Puranik hearing the case observed that it had been proved beyond reasonable doubt they had committed heinous acts resulting in numerous deaths , PTI reported . Syed and Fehmida have been found guilty of planting the bomb in taxis at LOC_Event India . Ansari delivered the bomb at LOC_Event . Special prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam has called it a '' rarest of rare '' case in which the trio had '' enjoyed their act of killing '' . Nikam said they had been unhappy with smaller blasts that resulted in low death tolls and hence used RDX for the twin blasts . This is for the first time that a married couple is being convicted by a POTA court for their involvement in carrying out blasts . After the sentencing , Fahmida broke down outside the court while her husband did not react and stood calm by her side . Ashrat said ` Is andhe kanoon se kya insaaf milega -LRB- what justice can you get when the law is blind -RRB- . Commenting on the verdict , Nikam said , ` We are happy that justice has been delivered . This would send a strong message to terrorists that they would get such punishment if they indulged in barbarous acts ' . ` Initially they had planted a bomb in a bus but since few people were killed , they decided to use powerful bombs on the instructions of Laskhar-e-Taiba , ' Nikam said . Nikam said Fehmida had played a major role in these bomb blasts . She not only planted a bomb in a bus on July 28 , 2003 , along with her husband 's friend Ashrat but also on August 25 , 2003 , she and her husband Hanif planted bombs in taxis at the LOC_Event . ` Fehmida had actively participated in the process of selection and approval of location of targets . Though Fehmida was a woman she was equally cruel as other accused in the execution of conspiracy , ' Nikam said . One bomb planted in a taxi went off outside the LOC_Event - the city 's most famous tourist attraction - killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens of others standing nearby . . . Another had exploded minutes earlier in a crowded LOC_Event , also in the south of the city , causing a huge number of casualties . There was no immediate claim of responsibility last night - but suspicion is likely to fall on Islamist extremists , possibly taking revenge for last year 's communal riots in the neighbouring state of Gujarat , where 2,000 Muslims died . . . The blasts follow a recent thaw in relations between Pakistan and India , which has accused Islamabad of supporting Islamist militants who have carried out previous attacks on Indian soil . . . Last night India 's Hindu nationalist prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , held an emergency cabinet meeting as police put the Indian capital , LOC_Event , and Gujarat 's riot-hit main city , Ahmedabad , on a state of high alert . . . Analysts warned that the blasts would damage already-strained relations between India 's majority Hindu community and the country 's 140 million Muslims . . . The first blast took place shortly after 1pm local time in the LOC_Event , LOC_Event 's packed gold and diamond market which had just opened . The bomb was hidden inside a taxi . . . It sent debris flying across a huge area , ripping into shops . More than 30 people were killed in the explosion . . . The second blast along LOC_Event 's crowded seafront took place four minutes later , shattering windows in the five-star Taj Mahal Hotel 200 metres away , which is used by the city 's wealthy elite and by Bollywood film stars . The taxi which contained the bomb had been dumped in a public car park . The blast left paving stones drenched with blood and littered with abandoned shoes . . . The hotel 's communications manager , Ravi Dubey , said no guests or foreign tourists had been hurt . `` This was a terrorist attack . It was too organised to be anything else , '' he said . `` They decided to strike at an elite area . '' . . Ingrid Alva , a public relations consultant who works near the Gateway , said : `` The building we were in shook and we heard a loud noise . I rushed out and saw the crowds at the Gateway of India . We saw some body parts lying around , before we were told to move away by the police . '' . . As hospitals struggled to cope with the wounded , police rounded up suspects , including a taxi driver . . . Last night police claimed they had also discovered a large amount of explosive concealed near a railway tunnel on the outskirts of LOC_Event . Around 100 detonators had been hidden along a busy commuter line at Igatpuri . . . The bombings bear a grim resemblance to a wave of explosions that shook LOC_Event in 1993 , killing 250 people . Those blasts were blamed on groups avenging Muslim deaths in Hindu-Muslim riots after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India . . . Yesterday India 's chief archaeological body released a report that claimed a temple had existed at the disputed religious site long before the mosque . It was not clear last night whether the report and the LOC_Event blasts were linked . . . .

SRINAGAR : A hitherto unknown militant outfit Lashkar-e-Qahab on Thursday claimed responsibility for Tuesday 's twin blasts in LOC_Event in which 20 people were killed and over 50 injured.A caller introducing himself as Abu Feroz , a spokesman of the outfit , contacted a private TV channel here claiming responsibility for the twin blasts and threatened similar attacks in other cities unless the government stopped its ` catch and kill ' campaign in Jammu and Kashmir.A staff of the TV channel said that Feroz spoke in Urdu with a heavy Punjabi accent.Police said they had heard the name of the militant outfit for the first time and that it could be an offshoot of some militant outfits active in the state . . . SSP Srinagar Muneer Ahmed Khan said they could not say with authority that the outfit was an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba . ` We will sift through the records to see if there is any link , ' Khan said . Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayiba militant outfit , whose member was shot dead in an encounter with police near Lucknow on Wednesday , appeared prima facie behind the blasts in LOC_Event , a senior Uttar Pradesh government official said in LOC_Event on Wednesday . . . Principal Secretary ( Home ) Alok Sinha told a hurriedly called press conference that security agencies probing the blasts have been able to `` uncover '' that the LeT terrorist , who was shot dead in an encounter with the Special Task Force of the state police near the state capital , was involved in them . . . `` Prima facie , it appears that the slain terrorist was involved in the twin blasts but it would be a matter of investigation to ascertain the degree of his involvement or whether he was the mastermind , '' Sinha said . . . Asked specifically whether LeT was involved in the blasts , Sinha said it could not be said with certainty as yet but hastened to add that the terrorist outfit keep on changing their names and also their modules . To a query about the possible involvement of Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence , the Home Secretary said , `` It was difficult to say whether it was involved . '' . . In reply to a question , he said there was no specific intelligence information about the possibility of a terrorist attack in the LOC_Event and added that , `` There never is any specific inputs on terrorist attacks . '' . . . NEW DELHI , March 7 -- Bombs exploded in a crowded LOC_Event and a LOC_Event in the holy city of LOC_Event on Tuesday evening , killing at least 15 people and raising fears of retaliatory violence against India 's minority Muslim population . Authorities appealed for calm and police officers in major cities were placed on high alert . . . Even before the blasts , communal tensions had been rising in India . Angry Muslim protests against President Bush , who visited India last week , as well as against cartoons of the prophet Muhammad , first published in a Danish newspaper , have erupted into violence in several cities . . . The first blast Tuesday ripped through the LOC_Event shortly after 6 p.m. as Hindu devotees gathered to make offerings to the monkey god Hanuman , Indian news agencies reported . Among the dead was a bridegroom who had come to seek the deity 's blessings , according to the Press Trust of India news service . Tuesday evening is the traditional time for visiting the temple . . . The second explosion came minutes later at the LOC_Event . The blast left a foot-deep crater , shattered windows and splattered the station with blood and body parts , the Press Trust reported . Four more unexploded bombs were found at another site next to the Ganges River . . . In an interview with the Reuters news agency , Navneet Sikera , senior superintendent of police in Varanasi , put the death toll at 15 , with 60 injured . The Press Trust said 20 people had died , including 14 at the train station . [ Five people died overnight of injuries , according to a police official cited by the Associated Press . ) . . Indian television footage of the bombed temple showed pools of blood and chunks of flesh amid scattered shoes and other debris . Injured survivors were carried to private vehicles and ambulances , and crowds of angry men waved their fists in the air . Many of the injured were said to be in critical condition . . . Situated in the state of Uttar Pradesh about 400 miles east of New Delhi , the historic , densely packed city of Varanasi is sometimes called the `` Hindu Jerusalem '' to underscore its significance to the followers of India 's dominant faith , who make up about 81 percent of the population . The city is a magnet for pilgrims who travel there for ritual baths in the Ganges River . And the most religious Hindus believe there is no better place to die than LOC_Event , whose waterfront is lined with cremation grounds . . . Authorities feared the bombings of such a sensitive site could trigger communal bloodletting . In 2002 , reports of a Muslim attack on a train carrying Hindu nationalists in the state of LOC_Event triggered rioting that left more than 1,000 people dead . Most of the dead in that episode were Muslims , who make up about 13 percent of India 's billion-plus people . . . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh `` has appealed for peace and calm , '' said his media adviser , Sanjay Baru . `` He is constantly monitoring the situation . '' . . Interior minister Shivraj Patil was en route to LOC_Event Tuesday night , as was Sonia Gandhi , leader of the Congress party , which heads the country 's governing coalition . . . Spokesmen for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , which leads the opposition , blamed the bombings on what they said was the government 's lax attitude toward terrorism , and called for a strike in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday . . . One key unanswered question Tuesday night was whether the bombings were the work of homegrown Islamic extremists or militant groups based in Pakistan . In the past , the Pakistani government has used such groups as a weapon in its conflict with India over the divided Himalayan province of Kashmir . . . In late 2001 , an attack on India 's Parliament that India blamed on Pakistan triggered a military standoff that raised fears of a nuclear exchange . The crisis was defused only under heavy U.S. and British diplomatic pressure . . . India and Pakistan embarked on peace negotiations that have lowered tensions , but Indian officials have continued to express skepticism over claims by Gen. Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president , that he has ended state support for militant groups . Indian authorities have identified the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba , which is based in Pakistan , as a primary suspect in the bombings of two LOC_Event markets that killed 60 people Oct. 29 . Musharraf has banned the group , although it continues to operate under a different name . . . Some analysts saw a possible connection between the bombings and Hindu-Muslim clashes in the city of LOC_Event on Friday that left four people dead . The clashes grew out of Muslim protests against Bush . Communal clashes also erupted in the coastal state of Goa . . . . A series of bomb blasts killed at least 21 people in the Indian holy city of LOC_Event last night . . . Security forces across the country were on high alert as intelligence officials hinted that the explosions , which also injured more than 60 people , were the work of Islamic militants . . . LOC_Event , 450 miles east of New Delhi , is one of Hinduism 's holiest cities and is filled with pilgrims visiting temples and bathing in the holy waters of the Ganges , which runs through the city . . . The first blast at the crowded LOC_Event killed 10 worshippers . Witnesses said debris , body parts and blood covered the temple 's floor . . . India factfile . . Eleven more people died in explosions 45 minutes later at a station a few miles away and inside a nearby train . A fourth bomb was defused in a residential district of LOC_Event . . . `` The entire country is shocked by the blasts and is trying to cope with the situation , '' said Mulayam Singh Yadav , chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh .

Government for not taking pre-emptive steps Vested interests could use blasts to trigger communal polarisation . . NEW DELHI : The Congress and the Left parties on Wednesday condemned the bomb blasts in Varanasi and regretted that the Bharatiya Janata Party was seeking to draw political mileage from the incident . . . Expressing its deep shock and strong condemnation , the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- said the fact that the blasts took place at a LOC_Event and in the LOC_Event in Varanasi shows the ` diabolical motive ' behind this terrorist attack , which is to create communal tensions and a backlash . . . ` Recognising the nature of this provocation , all sections of the people must rebuff this heinous attempt , ' the party Polit Bureau said in a statement . The party said while it is time for people to be united and determined to counter such terrorist violence , it was unfortunate that the BJP was resorting to mean politics by attributing the terrorist outrage to so-called minority appeasement by the Government and the secular parties . . . ` This is an exhibition of the type of communal politics which vitiates the atmosphere in the country , ' the party said and called upon the Uttar Pradesh Government and the Centre to track down the culprits and identify and proceed against the groups and networks responsible for such terrorist acts . . . Demanding that the perpetrators of such a crime should not go scot-free , the CPI said the Union and the State Governments should make all efforts to pin down the culprits . . . ` The political parties must refrain from politicising the incident which may lead to communal polarisation of the people in U.P. and elsewhere . The timing of the terror act and its execution appear to have -LSB- been -RSB- aimed at deflecting the discourse on vital issues concerning the people and the country and disrupting the united actions of the people , ' the party Central Secretariat said in its statement . . . The Congress said that when it was in the Opposition it did not disrupt proceedings during terrorist attacks on temples like Akshardham in Gandhinagar and Raghunath in Jammu , the Red Fort and Parliament . . . Did the BJP not celebrate Holi then , asked party spokesperson Rajiv Shukla , reacting to the BJP suggestion that the party would not participate in the Holi festival next week . The party flayed the BJP decision to take out twin yatras and dubbed them as ` riot yatras ' . . . Speedy probe . . The CPI -LRB- ML -RRB- Liberation too strongly condemned the blasts and called for speedy and credible probe to identify the guilty and ensure swift punishment . The party also condemned the Mulayam Singh Government for not taking pre-emptive steps to stop any recurrence of such incidents , especially in the backdrop of the Mau riots and tension in Lucknow following recent anti-Bush protests . The party cautioned that vested political interests in Uttar Pradesh could use the blasts to trigger communal polarisation . . . PTI reports : The Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Home Minister Shivraj Patil visited Varanasi on Wednesday to take stock of the situation . LUCKNOW : A mastermind of the recent LOC_Event blasts and five of his accomplices were arrested on Wednesday by the Uttar Pradesh police and Central security agencies .

Wali Ullah and his accomplices were arrested from different parts of the State and a large quantity of arms and ammunition recovered from them , Jagmohan Yadav , Inspector-General of Special Task Force of the police , told reporters . . . The five were : Mehbook Ali , a resident of North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal , Syed Shuaib Hussain and Farhan of Lucknow , and Mohammad Rizwan Siddique and Mohammad Saad Ali from Jyotiba Phule Nagar district , he said . . . Trained with Jaish . . Wali Ullah , who had trained with the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed , was extending ` all help ' to the cadre of the HuJI , which is banned by India and Pakistan . . . Telephone calls made by Wali Ullah made the sleuths close in on him . . . He had made calls to the same number to which militants , who had planted the bombs at the LOC_Event and the LOC_Event cantonment railway station , had made . . . Wali Ullah , who was presented before the mediapersons , said the HuJI could even be responsible for the last year 29/10 LOC_Event blasts , an explosion in LOC_Event last year and a blast on board the Shramjeevi Express last year .

The statements of the injured would be recorded to get evidence . ` There were not many people near the mosque 's tank where the blasts took place . We are trying to contact them to find out if they had seen anyone planting the bombs , ' said a police officer . . . Crude devices . . The bombs used in the twin blasts appear to be similar to the ones used by the Pakistan-based top Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- militant , Abdul Karim Tunda , to trigger explosions in the Capital way back in 1996-98 . . . Initial investigations have indicated that no timer device was used in the bombs , creating a strong suspicion that chemicals -- readily available in the market -- were used to prepare them . The technique of manufacturing such crude bombs was popularised by Tunda in the mid-1990s . . . The police suspect that similar bombs were used in the explosions at LOC_Event on Friday . . . Though the police are probing the role of all the extremist outfits , it is learnt that for the time being they are concentrating more on local groups suspected to be operating from Delhi or neighbouring Uttar Pradesh . . . ` The nature of injuries and fewer number of casualties suggest that the explosions were carried out just to create terror .

Photo Gallery : LOC_Event Suburban Train Blasts . . Highly placed government sources told The Hindu that the blasts in LOC_Event 's local trains was ` clearly a job of Lashkar ' and the objective was to raise the ` tempo of communal violence ' in the country . . . Security and intelligence chiefs , officials of the Union Home Ministry and senior government officials who attended the emergency security review meeting at the Race Course Road residence of the Prime Minister also discussed the ` coordinated ' modus operandi of the blasts and the assessment was that Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind it with the objective of raising the tempo of communal violence across the country . . . The main worry and challenge , sources pointed out , was to ensure that such incidents did not occur at any other city or sensitive place in the country . With this aim , Home Ministry sent out advisories to all the States , alerting them of potential threats and asking them to put their law and order machinery in top gear . New Delhi was also put on a high state of red alert . . .

Duggal and Intelligence Bureau chief E.S.L. Narasimhan . . . While appealing to the people to stay calm , Dr. Singh said , ` The Government will take all possible measures to maintain law and order and defeat the forces of terrorism .

Suri and senior Railway Board officials will accompany them . . . It was decided to tighten security at all airports , vital installations , railway stations and sensitive places . The Centre was in constant touch with the Maharashtra Government and offered all assistance to the State Government . . .

Top Home Ministry officials were in touch with the police commissioners of Hyderabad , Kolkata , Bangalore , Pune , Nagpur and the police chiefs of Uttar Pradesh and other States . . . Mr. Patil said all information from LOC_Event was being collected ; anything about the blasts could be stated only after detailed investigations and analysis . . . The blasts during peak traffic hours in suburban trains smacked of the modus operandi adopted during the March 1993 serial blasts in busy places such as the stock exchange and markets where RDX was used by terrorists , killing nearly 300 people and injuring 700 . doweshowbellyad = 0 ; . . Bomb Blast at LOC_Event in the train LOC_Event on Tuesday . -LRB- TOI -RRB- . . NEW DELHI : The terror attack on LOC_Event trains was carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and local Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- activists and was designed to trigger communal conflagration in the country 's financial capital , intelligence sources said . While still waiting for clues to emerge , top intelligence sources in New Delhi seem pretty sure the blasts on the trains were plotted by Lashkar modules which are increasingly collaborating with activists of SIMI , which boasts of strong pockets of influence across Maharashtra . The estimate of intelligence agencies here is derived from the scale of the attack , as well as precise information about the Lashkar 's sleeper cells that have proliferated in Maharashtra . Sources in the home ministry , in fact , said that a carnage had seemed very much on the cards with information pouring in about stockpiling of arms and explosives by religious extremists . . . doweshowbellyad = 0 ; . . Bomb blast at LOC_Event railway station . -LRB- Mumbai Mirror -RRB- . . Unlike last time when tip-offs helped the Maharashtra police foil the fidayeen attack on RSS headquarters at Nagpur , this time , Maharashtra and central sleuths failed to detect the plot . ` Every time , you can not be lucky . Information as to which train they are going to attack and where is not easy to come by , ' said a top intelligence official engaged in counter-terror operations . Officials here are convinced that the terrorists ' objective was to cause communal mayhem in the city . The conviction is based on two facts . First , the trains were targeted just after the communal-tinged violence in Bhiwandi , and the protests by Shiv Sainiks over the insult to the statue of Meenatai Thackeray by miscreants . A survivor of the bombings on the rail system in India 's largest city says a blast damaged his train car so badly that he was amazed anyone got out in one piece . . . Santosh Raphod was on his way home from work during Tuesday 's rush hour in LOC_Event when the carriage he was riding in exploded , he toldCBC News on Wednesday . . .

Train carriages alongthe city 's widely used western rail line were ripped open between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. local time . No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks . . . Raphod said he was standing about three metresfrom the bomb when it exploded . . . `` I could n't hear the sound , I was very close to the bomb , '' he said . `` After a few seconds , everything was blacked out . All dust was all over us . '' . . Raphod said he realized a few seconds later that he was injured . . . `` My head was hit with a splinter . I was bleeding , '' he said . . . Bleeding from head , he stumbled out . . He said he did n't even realize he had been knocked down until another man told him . The pair made their way out of the train onto the tracks . . . Raphod said he was stunned by the state of the train car . . . `` It was totally broken down . I was surprised to see how people came out in one piece because the train was so badly damaged , '' he said . . . There was chaos in the neighbouring carriage , which was a ladies first-class compartment . LOC_Event , likea number of other major cities in the world , offers women-only cars in response to complaints of groping and sexual harassment . . . `` There was panic . They were crying all around , '' said Raphod . . . He received several stitches in his head and remained in hospital three hours for observation . Raphod said he stayed home from work Wednesday because of `` terrible '' head pain . . . LOC_Event needs rail system ` lifeline ' . . Raphod said he is concerned about future attacks , but said the commuter rail system is crucial to LOC_Event because it is fast and inexpensive . . . LOC_Event 's commuter rail line , whichcarries more than six million passengerseach day , is among the most crowded rail systems in the world . . . `` There is no alternative for [ LOC_Event ) people , '' said Raphod . `` It is the lifeline of [ LOC_Event ) .

MUMBAI : Just 12 hours after seven serial blasts left a trail of death and woes , Mumbai moved towards normality on Wednesday . . . Photo Gallery : Mumbai LOC_Event Blasts : The Day After . . Even as the day broke over a city that has still to recover from Tuesday terror , trains began running on the very tracks where bombs ripped through carriages . And office goers , school and college students and workers made their way to different parts of the city . . . The aftermath of the bombings , however , hung heavy on the city , as hundreds of people continued their weary search for missing relatives and family members . . . The scenes at various government and municipal hospitals were heart-rending as scores of people waited for news about the identity of the injured and those killed . Many of the bodies in morgues had not been identified . . . Director General of Police P.S. Pasricha told the media that 186 people had died and 772 injured . Information centres , manned by senior officials , had been set up at hospitals . ` Mumbai people have shown their big hearts , ' he said referring to the way people helped those injured . . . Mr. Pasricha refused to hazard a guess about who was responsible for the bombings . He said the investigation had been handed over to the Anti-Terrorist Squad and samples from the targeted coaches sent to the Central Forensic Laboratory . He said he would not speculate about the nature of the explosive used although it did appear to be RDX , given the intensity of the blasts . . . Asked whether the bombings reflected an intelligence failure , he said , ` We are not super human beings . ' The police had some idea that Mumbai would be a target . ` We did as much as we could , ' he said , and referred to the police interception of supplies of RDX and guns in Nashik , Aurangabad and LOC_Event two months back . . . Mr. Pasricha said security had been enhanced all over the State . The Central Reserve Police Force and the Rapid Action Force had also been deployed . . . Tracks repaired . . The most important factor that led to a semblance of normality on Wednesday was the speed with which the LOC_Event network was restored . On any ordinary day , this network transports an estimated six million people . Without it , the city can not move . Western Railway officials told The Hindu that within three hours of the first of the seven bomb blasts , a skeletal suburban rail service was started . . . From just before 10 p.m. on Tuesday night , services were run from Churchgate to Bandra and later to Andheri . As a result , stranded people had some chance to get back to their homes . . . By 1.20 a.m. , the Railways had begun the work of removing the rakes with the shattered carriages that were stationary at the different stations . . . The job was completed by a little before 6 a.m. . As a result , by 6.30 a.m. , the suburban rail network had begun functioning partially with trains running at 15 minute intervals . . . By 10 a.m. , normal services were resumed . However , the number of people was fewer on Wednesday than normal . LOC_Event , India , July 11 A string of powerful bombs ripped through a vital spine of Mumbais commuter train system during the evening rush hour on Tuesday , killing nearly 200 people , bringing Indias financial capital to a standstill and resurrecting memories of bloodbaths past.Skip to next paragraphAudio Report by Somini Sengupta ( mp3 ) MultimediaMap : Rail AttacksPhotographs : Train Bombings in IndiaEnlarge this ImageAdeel Halim/ReutersVictims were treated at a city hospital . More Photos The Indian police placed the death toll at 190 , with the number of wounded exceeding 600 , according to the Press Trust of India . The casualties are likely to climb , for if nothing else , it was clear even in the chaotic aftermath of the blasts that the attacks were as cold-blooded as they were well-coordinated , intended to inflict maximum carnage . The bombs struck at least seven trains along the western railway line of the citys north-south commuter train system between 6 and 7 p.m. , virtually within minutes of one another . Every day , more than six million people ride the trains in LOC_Event , formerly Bombay , making it among the busiest public transportation systems in the world.The televised aftermath showed the wreckage of mangled trains , torn limbs and stunned , injured commuters , some with blood-streaked faces . Witnesses said the healthy rushed forward to rescue the most badly wounded . Bedsheets and saris were thrown from people living near the tracks to be used as stretchers . It was a horrifying sight , Kishan Namdev Shelke , 57 , a train guard , recalled after carrying some of the dead and wounded in his arms . The attacks bore an obvious resemblance to the terrorist attacks on the London public transportation system last July and the LOC_Event bombings in March 2004 . But they also reminded many here of a series of bomb blasts in this city of 17 million in 1993 , later attributed to organized crime , that killed more than 250 people . With much still unknown about Tuesdays blasts and Indias own long history as a victim of terrorist violence much of it predating the rise of global Islamist terrorist networks it was impossible to draw immediate conclusions about the forces behind the attacks . For now , there was no concrete evidence linking Tuesdays explosions in LOC_Event to any particular group , nor any claim of responsibility . It was not clear how the bombs had been planted , what materials had been used , or whether they were the work of suicide bombers.The Indian prime minister , Manmohan Singh , urged calm and blamed unnamed terrorists for the attack . The prime minister , in a statement , described the attacks as shocking and cowardly . Earlier on Tuesday , a series of grenade explosions struck LOC_Event , the summer capital of Indian-administered Kashmir , hitting a tourist bus . Eight people were killed and more than 40 wounded . The violence coincided with local elections in Pakistan-administered Kashmir . Both nations claim the Himalayan territory.We will work to defeat the evil designs of terrorists and will not allow them to succeed , Mr. Singh said in his statement.Pravin Pereira , a graphic designer , was on his way from work when his train , which had stopped at Borivili station on the northern edge of the city , shook violently from a loud blast . The bomb had exploded three compartments ahead of him , in a mens compartment of the 5:47 p.m. train out of the central station.The sound was terrible , really terrible , Mr. Pereira , 33 , said by telephone . Everyone started running . There were a number of bodies lying there on the railway tracks.Artie Jacinto , 41 , was on her way home on a train that had just pulled out of the Matunga Road station when she heard the deafening sound of one blast , followed by the screams of the women around her . The train plunged into darkness , she said . She jumped out as quickly as she could , she recalled later by telephone . Strangers poured out of nowhere to help with rescue operations . She said she watched as a man poured cold water on the head of a badly wounded passenger.Mr . Shelke , the train guard , said he was in the last of nine compartments of Train No. 1748 , from the Churchgate station , when he heard what he described as thunder and lightning . Then he saw bodies tumbling out of the train . He pulled the emergency brake and brought the train to a halt . 12Next Page Saritha Rai reported from LOC_Event for this article , and Somini Sengupta from New Delhi .

For Hitesh Shah , travel by train will never be the same again . At around 6.20 pm , Shah was on a Western Railway foot over-bridge , crossing from LOC_Event West to the East , when he heard a loud bang . He looked down to see a train moving quickly beneath the bridge , coming to a halt a few seconds later . . . At first , he assumed it was a short circuit that led to the halt . When he took a second look , he saw dead bodies flying out of the LOC_Event fast train . Blood was flowing like a river all around . ` People were screaming for help and many were jumping out from other compartments . No one knew what was happening , ' he recalls . . . Without fearing for his life , he ran down to the tracks to help people trapped in the train . The first class compartment , where the bomb was placed , had been reduced to a tangled mass of metal in seconds . When the blast occurred , people standing at the platform waiting to board other trains were also swept off their feet . . . People staying around Mahim station soon arrived in large numbers to help the trapped passengers . Heavy rains did n't deter them from the rescue operations . . . ` It was gruesome , ' says Shah . ' I saw mutilated bodies . I do n't think anyone in that compartment could have come out alive . The intensity of the blast was very high . Some people got sheets from their homes to take out the dead . Those who were breathing were immediately rushed to the nearest hospital . ' . . Tulsi Pipe Road , which runs parallel to LOC_Event station , witnessed another horrifying scene as locals began dumping dead bodies on the street and trying to save the injured with a sense of urgency . Traffic leading to Dharavi was brought to a halt and diverted via Lady Jamshedji Road . . . Locals were seen consoling unknown passengers who could n't believe their near and dear ones were no more .

Krishna Mishra , who was in a slow train bound for Borivli , said there was no sign of the police for almost an hour . ` The least they can do at times like this is arrive on time , ' he says . ` Even when they came , they were beating and shooing away rescuers who were helping the injured . ' . . Many locals are angry that the government had done little to save the lives of ordinary people . ` We should not give these terrorists bail .

We fail to understand their mentality , ' said one such mourner . . . Meanwhile , the BMC lent a helping hand and announced that all funeral services would be free of cost keeping in mind the scope of the tragedy that struck this teeming metropolis . . . Most of the people who lost their relatives , earlier heaved a sigh of relief as the identified bodies were handed over to relatives without any hassles after completion of due formalities . . . Even as relatives were busy preparing for the last rites , rain gods also joined them in the mourning , lashing occasional showers all during the day . . The Central government on Wednesday claimed to have got some ` leads ' on the LOC_Event serial blasts that has as yet claimed the lives of about 190 suburban train passengers but remained tightlipped on who was responsible for it . . . ` We have leads about the LOC_Event blasts but no arrests have been made , ' Home Secretary V K Duggal told media persons after a meeting with Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel and top officials in New Delhion beefing up security at airports . . . ` Though there is no possibility of terrorist attacks on vital and prime economic installations following the LOC_Event blasts , all systems are being put in place to ensure security , ' he said . . . Duggal said the number of security equipments , manpower , baggage and personal check-in systems were being put in place . Appealing to passengers to cooperate with security officials at the airports , Patel said : ` Some concrete decisions have been taken -LRB- in regard to the security beef-up -RRB- and these will be implemented . ' . . Later in the day , Maharashtra Director General of Police P S Pasricha too claimed that certain leads had been found in the case . Addressing a press conference in Mumbai , Pasricha said the state government 's first priority in the wake of the blasts was to provide relief to the injured and much success had been achieved in this . ` We have held meeting with authorities of both Western and Central Railways to discuss ways and means to restore normalcy as soon as possible , ' Pasricha said . ` Security has been tightened across Maharashtra . Metal detectors and dog squads will be deployed at railway stations , ' he said , adding that some measures will be implemented immediately while others will take some time to be put into effect . He praised the citizens of Mumbai for displaying ` admirable resilience ' and for lending a helping hand to their fellow citizens in the aftermath of the bombings . The police were interacting with political and religious leaders and asking them to counsel their followers to maintain calm and restraint , he said . . The LOC_Event police suspect that a new module of the Lashkar-e-Tayiba that may have penetrated LOC_Event recently , could be responsible for yesterday 's serial bomb blasts that killed over 190 people and left over 600 injured . . . LOC_Event crime branch officials , who probed the blasts conducted by the Lashkar in LOC_Event in 2002 and 2003 , told PTI that the entire LeT module involved in those blasts had been exposed . Two to three LeT operatives from the module , who are absconding , do not seem to be involved in yesterday 's blasts , they said . . . ` It could be an entirely new LeT module that has entered LOC_Event with the specific assignment of executing yesterday 's blasts , ' officials said . . . From the damage caused to the railway compartments and the number of casualties , the LOC_Event police suspect the use of RDX in the blasts , but tjey are also not ruling out the possibility of compacted low-intensity explosives . This possibility is being explored against the backdrop of the seizure of 43 kg of RDX by the Anti Terrorists Squad from Aurangabad and other parts of Marathwada and north LOC_Event in the past few months . . . ` More RDX consignments could still be hidden in LOC_Event and around , and the same may have been used in yesterday 's blasts , ' a LOC_Event police official said . . . A senior LOC_Event crime branch officer told PTI that there was a definite pattern in the blasts and the entire operation was executed with great precision . The samples collected from the blast-hit trains have been sent for forensic examination , and experts said it would take some time to reach a definite conclusion . . . While Mumbai Police Commissioner A N Roy could not be contacted , ATS chief K P Raghuvanshi told PTI , ` It it too premature to comment on the issue . ' . . Meanwhile , an initial probe into Tuesday 's serial blasts in Mumbai 's suburban trains has revealed that the explosions were probably timed to trigger off at 6:15 pm , and the explosive devices could have been loaded at LOC_Event , the police said today . . . All the seven blasts aboard suburban trains on the Western Railway line took place between 6 pm and 6.30 pm yesterday , and the pattern that has been derived by the police is that all took place on north-bound slow and fast trains that originated from LOC_Event . . . Mumbai Crime Branch sources told PTI that going by the previous experiences of the train blasts in LOC_Event , it was likely that the explosive devices were loaded at LOC_Event and were fitted with commonly used mechanical timers set to explode at 6.15 pm . . . ` The perpetrators wanted to create an atmosphere of terror and knew that triggering simultaneous blasts in various parts of the city would serve the purpose , ' a senior crime branch official said , adding that the suspects may have disembarked from the trains at stations immediately after LOC_Event . . The government on Wednesday said the Indian economic growth story is intact and a dastardly act like the serial bomb blasts in LOC_Event on Tuesday will not break the country 's resolve to move forward . . . ` This kind of cowardly and dastardly act -LRB- blasts in LOC_Event on Tuesday -RRB- will not break our will and resolve to move forward , ' Finance Minister P Chidambaram told reporters in New Delhi . . . A solitary attack can not be a setback to economic activity all over India or even in Mumbai , Chidambaram said . . . Serial bomb blasts ripped through suburban trains in LOC_Event on Tuesday , killing at least 190 people and injuring over 600 others . . . On Wednesday , life in the city returned to normal as train services resumed and schools and colleges remained open . Chidambaram said the country 's economic growth story is intact with industrial and manufacturing growth remaining buoyant . . . Official data on industrial production released on Wednesday showed that the strong performance in the manufacturing sector pulled the overall Index of Industrial Production marginally up to 9.8 per cent during April-May of the current fiscal as compared to 9.5 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005-06 . . . Manufacturing shot up by 10.9 per cent in April-May this fiscal from 10.3 per cent last fiscal . . . Chidambaram said investors continued to repose confidence in the Indian economy . . . Attractive quarterly results announced by IT major Infosys Technologies rescued the stock markets from a major plunge after the serial blasts and placed the benchmark index Sensex considerably higher by 170.46 points , according to latest reports . . . . . LOC_Event blasts : Complete Coverage . . ` Economic impact of blasts to be limited ' . . Blasts : Minimal impact on markets . Leader of Opposition L K Advani said on Wednesday that the serial bomb blasts on LOC_Event 's suburban trains have brought to the fore the need for an anti-terrorist law . . . ` The blasts show that the government of Pakistan has not kept up its committment to dismantle anti-India terrorist infrastructure on Pakistani soil , ' Advani told reporters after visiting the injured at Bhabha and KEM hospitals and LOC_Event railway station , one of the seven blast sites . . . Refusing to criticise LOC_Event government directly , he said , ` This is a time when raja and praja must unitedly face the challenge before them . ' . . The senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader said it was the responsibility of the Central and LOC_Event governments to demolish the terrorist modules operating within . . . About the blasts themselves , he said they were far more well-coordinated than London metro blasts last year . . . Referring to media reports about the alleged involvement of the banned Students Islamic Movement of LOC_Event , he said , ` Its footprints and those of similar anti-national elements must be investigated and erased . ' . . Just like the 9/11 attacks were not just an attack on New York , but the entire United States , Tuesday 's serial blasts in LOC_Event were not just an attack on the commercial capital but on the entire nation , Advani added . . . Replying to a query on theUnion Home Secretary 's statement that Indo-Pak peace process will continue , Advani said , ` If you want to deal firmly with terrorism we should not give an impression that you are ready to make any compromise . The image of being a soft nation encourages terrorism . ' . . He also demanded that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim be brought to LOC_Event to stand trial in the 1993 LOC_Event serial bomb blasts case . . . Suspecting the don 's role in Tuesday 's serial blasts , Advani said Dawood is to 7/11 what Osama Bin Laden is to 9/11 . . . Dawood has been named absconding accused in the March 12 , 1993 serial blasts case in which CBI has alleged that the underworld don masterminded the explosions to destablise the country . . . After several claims by LOC_Event that Dawood was hiding in Pakistan , the neighbouring country has denied reports that he was holed up in the country . . Condemning the serial blasts in LOC_Event , the Left parties on Wednesday said the blasts were designed to rip apart the country 's social fabric and demanded a thorough probe into the ` serious intelligence lapse ' . . . '' The central and state governments must not spare any effort to track down the perpetrators of the heinous crime and take steps to eliminate the network sustaining the terrorists who indulge in organised fanatical operations , ' leaders of the Communist Party of India-Marxist , Communist Party of India , Forward Bloc , Revolutionary Socialist Party and CPI -LRB- M-L -RRB- said . . . The Left parties , while postponing the first phase of their anti-price rise week -LRB- July 13-19 -RRB- , have instructed their units to immediately hold meetings and take out silent processions to condemn the terrorist attacks . . . CPI-M leader and Rajya Sabha member Sitaram Yechury along with two LOC_Event party unit leaders will also undertake an on-the-spot study on the LOC_Event blasts , begining Thursday . . . The party has also organised relief work there . . . The CPI-M politburo statement in Delhi flayed the series of bomb blasts in the suburban railway network as a vicious terrorist attack . . . The Left party also demanded adequate compensation to the kin of those killed and provision of all medical help to the injured , while complimenting the people of Mumbai ` who had risen like one man in the face of series of blasts ' on Tuesday , which left 190 people dead and several hundred injured . . . The CPI also condemned the attack on tourist buses in Srinagar leading to the death of eight people and injuries to several others . . British intelligence analystRichard M Bennett says the serial attacks in LOC_Event were masterminded by outfits from abroad . . . According to him , ` The level of sophistication and organisation needed to carry out such a widespread and tightly coordinated attack is beyond the known capabilities of any of the Islamic groups operating in either Kashmir or elsewhere in India . ' . . In an e-mail to rediff.com immediately after the blasts , he said , ` This has all the hallmarks of a Special Forces/Intelligence operation ... it may have been carried out by expendable extremists , but those who were the promoters and brains have military training . ' . . ` The Mumbai blasts is an attack on India 's soft underbelly , ' said Ajit Doval , former director , Intelligence Bureau . . . Doval too agrees with the views of the British expert . ` From my experience I think that the blasts are not an indigenous effort . It is the exported variety of terrorism . The blasts of LOC_Event have a foreign origin and it is obvious that a lot of effort has gone behind its execution . ' . . Doval , who extensively investigated fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim 's involvement in the March 12 , 1993 LOC_Event bomb blasts , said , ` The saboteurs are telling India that they are alive , kicking and have the capacity to strike at any place in India , at a time of their choosing . ' . . ` India must give a counter message , ' Doval said . ` We must prove that we have the capacity to hound them wherever they are . Terrorists must get the message that the threshold level of patience of Indians is not infinite . If we do n't do something now then the enemies of India will keep surprising us . ' . . ` Today 's blasts must have involved more than 25 people who might have knowingly and unknowingly participated . It is very likely that the masterminds are not in India . The actual perpetrators may not be more than four or five but these guys must have got help from many people . The infrastructure for these blasts must have been quite big . Motor vehicles , local agents , people who provided cover to terrorists and people who planted the devices must have been involved . They should be and will be found out . ' . In a new twist to LOC_Event bomb blasts probe , three accused on Wednesday made a confession before a competent authority about their involvement in the conspiracy but soon thereafter two of them retracted before a magistrate , saying they had not made a voluntary disclosure . . . Farooq Anwar Iqbal Maqdumi , Shaikh Mohammed Ali Alam Shaikh and Asif Khan Bashir Khan alias Junaid purportedly made a confession this morning before a Deputy Commissioner of Police , a competent authority to record confession under LOC_Event Control of Organised Crime Act . . . Later , Shaikh Mohammed Ali and Asif Khan alias Junaid retracted their confession before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate , saying it was not given voluntarily . . . This was revealed to a special court by the accused themselves when they were produced before it for remand . . . The development assumes significance as under MCOCA , a confession does not have evidential value if it is not a voluntary and true disclosure . . . Altogether five accused were produced before judge Mridula Bhatkar who remanded four of them -- Salman Farsi , Farooq Anwar , Shaikh Mohammed and Asif Khan to judicial custody till December 15 and Mohammed Zahid Abdul Majid to police custody till December 16 . . . Seeking their remand , public prosecutor Raja Thakre said the accused had played a vital role in the conspiracy and investigations conducted by Anti-Terrorist Squad so far had revealed involvement of more persons who are yet to be arrested . . MUMBAI : Seven persons walked out of two Mumbai jails on Wednesday evening after having spent five years in the dark , dingy cells . Free for now , the seven were greeted with hugs , tears , smiles and sweets , as the wait finally ended for the them as well as the dozens of people who had lined up to meet them outside the prison gates . The seven , accused of planning and executing the 2006 Malegaon serial bomb blasts , were recently granted bail by a MCOCA court . ` We were framed in these cases . We want our dignity and five years back , ' a statement said . The anger at the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- was also evident , with the seven men later alleging that the agency had been biased in its probe . On September 8 , 2006 , four RDX bombs went off in LOC_Event , killing 31 people . On Wednesday , six of the accusedSalman Farsi , Mohammed Zahid , Raees Ali , Shabbir Masiullah , Noor-ul-Huda and Dr Farog Makhdoomiwere released from the Arthur Road prison , while Abrar Ahmed stepped out of the Byculla jail . Two others Mohd Ali Shaikh and Asif Bashir Khan alias Junai who were also granted bail would remain in jail as they are also accused in the 7/11 serial train blasts . All seven men released were keen to reach home . ' I am happy that we have been released . But I will find peace only when I am discharged from the case , ' said Farsi , tears in his eyes . ` We want our dignity back . We want an answer as to why the police wrongly framed us , ' maintained Raees Ali . Zahid said , ` The police showed me as a planter , but I was 500km away from LOC_Event . The truth is coming out now . I will be relieved when we are acquitted , ' said Masiullah . Times View The NIA 's decision to not oppose bail to these accused in the 2006 LOC_Event blasts case based on a review of the evidence suggests that it has prima facie reached the conclusion that they are innocent of this crime . If so , merely releasing them from prison five years after the event is clearly not enough . From a civil rights point of view , each of them must be paid a compensation of not less than Rs 5 lakh per year for wrongful confinement if the police ultimately admit that they were innocent . The investigating agencies also need to introspect on the damage done to their credibility and the fuel such incidents provide to fears that community profiling underlies their investigations . LOC_Event : The police are probing whether the Bajrang Dal or a Lashkar group could have been involved in Friday 's Malegaon blasts . The Bajrang Dal is known to have followed a similar pattern in blasts at Parbhani 's Mohammadi Masjid and mosques at Pona and Jalna earlier this year . ` We are probing this angle , though it is too early to hold any group responsible , ' DGP P S Pasricha said on Friday.Another theory doing the rounds is that a Jaish-e-Mohammad module could have engineered Friday 's blasts to create communal trouble . Anti-Terrorism Squad joint commissioner of police K P Raghuvanshi , too , said : ` It is too premature to say anything , but we are also probing the earlier Nanded and Parbhani blasts . ` The ATS arrested 16 Bajrang Dal activists for the earlier blasts , but there were allegations about cops going slow on the probes.Four persons , also reported to be Bajrang Dal activists , died while making bombs in Nanded earlier this year . Those arrested later told interrogators they wanted to avenge several blasts across the country.Communal violence angle : Intelligence agencies suspect that the Malegaon blasts were aimed at provoking communal tension as terrorists could not foment trouble during the recently concluded Ganapati festival . A senior official from one of the central agencies in Pune said similar , subversive acts had been planned during the 10-day Ganapati festival . However , tight security measures prevented any untoward incident . ` There was no specific intelligence input on LOC_Event , ' the official said . ` The motive seems not only to kill people , but also create panic and communal tension in the already sensitive LOC_Event , ' he said , explaining that after failing to cause damage during the Ganesh festival , LOC_Event could have been seen as a soft target.Interestingly , the district administration , after a seizure of arms and ammunition from Malegaon in May and the serial blasts in Mumbai 's suburban trains , had submitted a confidential report to the LOC_Event home department about the sensitive communal situation in the town . The improvised explosive devices -- reportedly of a primitive nature -- had been placed possibly in bicycles left parked near places where the local Muslims usually congregate as they come out of the local mosque after Friday prayers.No claim of responsibility has so far been made by any organisation . The police do not as yet have any indicators regarding the likely identity of the perpetrators.The Muslims -- many of them migrant weavers from Uttar Pradesh -- constitute the majority of the population in Malegaon . One estimate says they constitute as high as 75 per cent of the local population . . . Over the years , there has been a steady economic degradation in the area giving rise to poverty , unemployment and feelings of marginalisation of the Muslims.Malegaon is a wake-up call to the Indian political leadership as to what could happen on the national scale if the seething Hindu and Muslim anger against each other and against the administration continues to grow by feeding upon each other.There is anger among large sections of the Hindus -- particularly the youth -- over the Government of India 's perceived failure to act firmly against the continuing acts of jihadi terrorism and its state-sponsor , namely , Pakistan.Including Malegaon , there have been seven major acts of terrorism affecting Hindu-Muslim relations since July last year in Indian territory outside Jammu and Kashmir . Of these , two were directed against Hindu places of worship ( LOC_Event in July 2005 and Varanasi in March 2006 ) . One was in a Muslim place of worship ( LOC_Event , April 2006 ) , one at Muslims outside their place of worship ( Malegaon , September 8 , 2006 ) . Two were indiscriminate attacks against civilians belonging to all communities ( Delhi , October 2005 and Mumbai , July 2006 ) and one was directed at scientists attending a conference at Bangalore ( December 2005 ) . Nearly 300 innocent civilians were killed in all these incidents -- the largest number of 184 killed being in the Mumbai blasts directed at LOC_Event . The second largest was in LOC_Event in October 2005 , when over 60 shoppers and other passers-by were killed . The third largest was in Malegaon.Investigations made so far indicate the likely involvement of Pakistani jihadi organisations -- mainly the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami -- in the blasts at LOC_Event , LOC_Event ( October 2005 ) , Bangalore , Varanasi and Mumbai.The identities of the organisations and perpetrators involved in the two explosions directed specifically at the Muslims in Delhi in April and LOC_Event are yet to be established . While the blast inside the main LOC_Event in LOC_Event could have been caused by a Muslim , the blasts in LOC_Event , which took place near the mosque after the prayers and not inside , do not necessarily permit such an inference.Over the years , there have been many instances of jihadi terrorists targeting Muslims too not only in Iraq and Afghanistan , but also in Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir . There have been instances of blasts organised by jihadi terrorists Iside mosques during prayers as well as outside mosques , on religious as well as on other occasions . . . One of the most sensational instances of Muslims deliberately killing Muslims was the explosion in LOC_Event in April when the entire leadership of the Barelvi Sunni Tehrik was killed by suspected Deobandi elements . The terrorists planted the IEDs at a public meeting to observe the birthday of the Holy Prophet . . . When it comes to acts of terrorism , jihadi terrorists do not make a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims , between civilians and the security forces.While one should not be surprised if the LOC_Event blasts also turn out to be the work of jihadi terrorists , one should not rule out at this stage the possibility of the involvement of non-Muslims , keeping in view the long history of tensions between the Muslims and Hindus in LOC_Event . . . These tensions are attributable to the activities of the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and the Students Islamic Movement of India in that area , the alleged sympathy for Osama bin Laden exhibited by some prominent members of the local Muslim community etc.In May last , a large quantity of explosives was reportedly recovered by the police from suspected jihadi extremists in the area indicating possible preparations for fresh acts of jihadi terrorism.The LOC_Event blasts have come at a time when there is considerable anger among the Muslim and Hindu youth against the Government of India for different reasons . This anger is noticeable in different parts of the country , particularly since the LOC_Event blasts of July 11 , 2006 . While the Muslims have been angered by what they look upon as the targeting of their community by the police in different places where acts of terrorism have taken place since July last year , the Hindu youth have been angered by what they view as the softness of the political leadership in New Delhi over the continuing acts of jihadi terrorism in different parts of the country.Since the present government came to power more than two years ago , there has been no successful investigation of major acts of terrorism in different parts of the country outside Jammu and Kashmir resulting in the identification , arrests and prosecution of the perpetrators by the police . . . Critics of the government feel that the unsatisfactory pace of the investigations is attributable to the fact that the police officers do not have the confidence that the political leadership would stand by them if leaders of the Muslim community accuse the investigating officers of being anti-secular , communal or prejudiced against the Muslim community.The reluctance of the government in New Delhi to make it clear to the complaining leaders of the Muslim community that while there is no question of blaming or suspecting the community as a whole because of the acts of a few terrorists , the law has to take its own course against those indulging in terrorism has contributed to the anger in large sections of the Hindu community against the government.There has been a deplorable attempt by some leaders of the Muslim community to create a divide between the community and the police by questioning the impartiality of the police and levelling other allegations against the investigating officers . Incidents like the blasts at LOC_Event , if they turn out to be the handiwork of jihadi terrorists , would serve the nefarious purpose of furthering the mental divide between the Hindus and Muslims and between the Muslims and the police.Responsible leaders of the two communities should jointly counter this trend . It also needs to be underlined that any ill-advised actions by angry elements of the Hindu community to give vent to their anger over the continuing acts of terrorism , by indulging in reprisal attacks against innocent members of the Muslim community would be detrimental to our national interests and could contribute to an unbridgeable divide between the two communities.The government should act with equal firmness against whoever indulges in acts of terrorism , irrespective of the community -- Muslim or Hindu -- to which he or she belongs . There can not be one law for the Muslims and another for non-Muslims . . . . MUMBAI/MALEGAON : In the first indication that the deadly blasts in Malegaon could have links with the 7/11 terror attacks , Maharashtra 's top police officer on Monday claimed there were vital leads in the powerloom town that could help crack the Mumbai train serial blasts . ` From the modus operandi , it is assumed that the same set of militants have carried out the blasts in Mumbai and LOC_Event , ' director-general of police P S Pasricha said.At least two people from a village near LOC_Event , who had given the perpetrators logistical support have been identified and will be picked up soon , a top police officer said . They were identified from sketches of the two men who bought cycles from a LOC_Event shop three hours before the blasts.Police said explosives used in LOC_Event were a cocktail of RDX , ammonium nitrate and fuel oil the same mixture used in 7/11 . TOI was the first to report this on Sunday.The Anti-Terrorist Squad has sent samples of the lethal cocktail to forensic labs at Chandigarh and Hyderabad as well as a military forensic lab.The ATS has prima facie ruled out the involvement of Hindu fundamentalist groups in the LOC_Event blasts citing two reasons . To begin with , RDX is only available to Islamic terrorist outfits . Secondly , Bajrang Dal activists so far have used only crude bombs , as seen in the blasts at Parbani and Nanded.The use of RDX confirmed the worst fears of LOC_Event , which has been in the news for all the wrong reasons . Police had seized a major haul of RDX and other arms and ammunition including AK-47 rifles after a search operation on May 12 . Tension has been simmering in the north Maharashtra town since the seizure in May . Investigators on Monday also released a third sketch , which is the artist 's image of the second accused based on descriptions provided by various witnesses.Police sources at Malegaon said four teams of five men each were sent to Ahmednagar , Aurangabad and Nanded in connection with the case . ` We have sent our teams within Maharashtra but do n't want to reveal much since it could hamper our investigation , ' P K Jain , inspector general -LRB- Nasik range -RRB- told TOI . LOC_Event : The Anti-Terrorist Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- arrested Raees Ahmed on Sunday for his complicity in the September 8 serial blasts in LOC_Event that killed 31 people . He was produced before a special MCOCA court that remanded him to police custody till November 16 . ` Raees is a conspirator and a bomb planter , ' said a senior ATS official . He is the brother-in-law of Shabbir Ahmed Masiullah alias Shabbir Batterywala , the prime conspirator , and was earlier arrested for his role in a September 13 bomb hoax at Malegaon . Over 300 injured in four blasts that rocked the powerloom town on the occasion of Shab-e-barat . Raees is a resident of Malegaon and a suspected SIMI activist . This is the third arrest in connection with the Malegaon blasts . Meanwhile , Shabbir Masiullah , who was arrested on November 2 in connection with the Malegaon case will be taken to Bangalore on Monday morning for a narco analysis test and lie-detector test , police said . ` The accused in this case are not co-operating in the investigation , so we are conducting scientific tests on them , since it would help us to carry out a fair and meticulous probe , ' said an officer attached to the Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- on Sunday.Shabbir , who is said to be a trained Lashkar-e-Taiba operative , is believed to have plotted the Malegaon blast to trigger communal tension and riots in the textile township , the police said . Malegaon police also registered a case over a fake bomb found on September 12 . They have claimed that the mud used in the dummy bomb was similar to the soil found near Shabbir 's battery unit . Investigators have also found traces of RDX in a battery manufacturing unit owned by Shabbir in Malegaon . The police suspect the bombs were manufactured at Shabbir 's battery unit . MUMBAI : The country 's premier anti-terror agency is set to file a chargesheet against four ultra-right Hindu activists for carrying out the 2006 LOC_Event blasts . The National Investigation Agency 's -LRB- NIA -RRB- probe has knocked the bottom off the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad 's -LRB- ATS -RRB- case that members of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- had carried out the attack . The chargesheet is expected to be filed any time this week . The blasts in the textile town on September 8 , 2006 , when people had gathered to observe the Shab-e-Baraat , had killed 37 people and injured 297 . The NIA , which started the probe in April 2011 on the Union home ministry 's orders , has so far arrested four people Dhan Singh , Lokesh Sharma , Manohar Singh and Rajendra Chaudhary for the blasts . Three others , Sandeep Dange , Ramji Kalsangra and Raj Mehul , are wanted in the case . The agency says Chaudhary , Dhan Singh , Manohar Singh and Kalsangra planted the bombs . A senior NIA official in Delhi refused to give more details citing the sensitivity of the case . Sharma , who is also an accused in the Samjhauta Express blast in 2007 , and Chaudhary were members of the Bajrang Dal . ` There can not be two sets of accused in one crime , ' said an NIA officer , adding the agency was examining if there was a larger conspiracy involved . Another officer said the agency might ask the court to dismiss the charges against the nine people arrested by the ATS . All were granted bail in November 2011 . On Friday , the NIA recorded the statement of Mohammed Atif , a prime witness in the case . The ATS had said Atif had witnessed the attackers making the bomb and later hid in the godown of one of the accused . Atif later told a court in his hometown in Uttar Pradesh that he was forced to give the statement . The NIA says the decision to bomb the textile town was taken by senior members of the right-wing Hindu module , including former RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi , who was later murdered allegedly by his own accomplices ; Kalsangra ; and Dange . Kalsangra and Sharma were tasked with the execution , and they asked Chaudhary , Dhan Singh and Manohar Singh to plant the bombs . The agency says the team first recced Malegaon to identify targets . On the day of the blasts , Sharma drove the team to LOC_Event , where Kalsangra gave them the RDX explosive and also clothes to disguise themselves as pious Muslims . Kalsangra accompanied Dhan Singh , Manohar Singh and Chaudhary to place the bombs on bicycles at spots near the LOC_Event at LOC_Event where many people had gathered . Sharma then drove them back to Indore . The ATS led by then joint commissioner K P Raghuvanshi and DIG Subodh Jaiswal filed a chargesheet in the case on December 21 the same year . It had taken just 54 days to file the chargesheet ; usually it can take up to 180 days in such cases . The Central Bureau of Investigation , after its own probe , had endorsed the ATS findings . The NIA , set up in 2009 , post the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks , can deal with terror-related crimes without any special permission from state governments . The agency focused on Hindu right-wing groups after a confession by Swami Aseemanand , arrested in the 2007 Hyderabad Mecca Masjid bomb blast case , it told the court last November . The agency has a Rs 10 lakh reward for Kalsangra and Dange . LOC_Event had seen another attack in 2008 allegedly by right-wing Hindu groups . Sadhvi Pragya Singh and former Lt Col Srikant Purohit were later arrested in connection with that attack . ATS 's claims in 2006 * Blasts were carried out by Muslim youths in an attempt to spark communal riots * The RDX for the bombs came from Pakistan and a Pakistani national , Muzammil , assembled them in Malegaon * A bomb each was planted by accused Noor-ul-Huda , Raees Ali and Abrar Ahmed * Zahid Majeed , an imam from Yavatmal , planted a bomb and returned the same day . -LRB- About 250 Yavatmal residents filed affidavits , saying Majeed was in the town at the time -RRB- * Shabbir Masiullah , a battery shop owner , was part of the conspiracy . -LRB- At the time of the blasts , he was in the custody of the Mumbai crime branch in another case -RRB- NIA claims * The RDX was procured in India . The explosives were allegedly planted by Dhan Singh , Rajender Chaudhary , Ramji Kalsangra and Manohar Singh . Dhan Singh also connected with the Samjhauta Express and 2008 Malegaon blasts * Another Samjhauta blast accused , Lokesh Sharma , provided logistical support * The blasts were plotted by former RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi , Kalsangra , Sandeep Dange , and others . Kalsangra and Sharma tasked with the execution * Chaudhary , Dhan Singh and Manohar Singh recced LOC_Event to identify the targets Legal Angle Prominent criminal lawyer Majeed Memon , who represented several 1993 bomb blast accused in court , said two ideologically diagonally opposite groups can not be responsible for a particular terror attack . Truth can not have two faces . ` The NIA has to necessarily discharge the earlier set of boys in this case , who were wrongly believed to be involved . ' . Special Correspondent . . A diabolic attempt to create communal tensions , says CPI -LRB- M -RRB- . . State Government must uncover motives behind the attack Ensure proper medical treatment for injured Terrorists can not weaken India . . NEW DELHI : Left parties on Saturday condemned the LOC_Event bomb blasts and asked the State Government and security agencies to uncover the motives behind the attack and track down those responsible . . . In a statement , the Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- said the blasts indicated a diabolic attempt to create communal tensions and provoke violence . Coming after the Mumbai train explosions , this attack should be viewed with utmost seriousness . . . `` The State Government and the concerned security agencies must uncover the motives behind this attack and track down those responsible . In this connection , the link with the blasts in Nanded in April this year which killed two Bajrang Dal activists while making bombs and the blasts in mosques in Parbani , Purna and Jalna in recent years must also be investigated , '' the statement said . . . Conveying its sympathy to all those who have lost their family members in these attacks , the Polit Bureau asked the State Government to ensure proper medical treatment for the injured and provide adequate compensation to families of the victims . . . The Polit Bureau called upon its State units to mobilise people against the designs of the extremist and terrorist groups and to foil their attempts to divide the people on communal lines . . . The Communist Party of India too condemned the serial bomb blasts and said if such an attack could take place despite an alert by the Government , the situation demanded more coordinated and effective measures against terrorists . . . In a statement , the party Central Secretariat said the terrorists would not succeed in weakening the country through such cowardly attacks targeting innocent people . `` The people of Maharashtra and India will show the same resilience of Mumbai on resisting the terrorists and maintaining the unity and harmony among the people , '' the statement said .

LOC_Event : A day after the Samjhauta Express was firebombed , the Haryana police released the sketches of two youths suspected to have planted the bombs in the train . . . While a reward of Rs . 1 lakh has been announced for anyone giving clues leading to the suspects , the police have sought the help of their counterparts in Delhi , Mumbai and Punjab in the investigations . . . At a press meet here on Tuesday , Inspector-General -LRB- Rohtak Range -RRB- Sharad Kumar and Bharti Arora , Superintendent of Police , Government Railway Police , released the sketches based on inputs given by some passengers . Mr. Kumar said one of the suspects was about 35 years old , fat and of wheatish complexion . He had a moustache and wore a jacket . The other one was about 26 years old and had his face covered with a muffler . . . The police believe that more than four persons could be involved in the incident . . . Harish Mohammed -LRB- 15 -RRB- , a resident of Karachi , died of burns in the Safdarjung Hospital in LOC_Event on Tuesday , taking the death toll to 68 . So far , 18 bodies have been identified , including 13 Pakistanis . An injured passenger told the police that soon after the train started moving from Delhi , there was a heated exchange between Railway Protection Force personnel and the suspects . The two said they wanted to go to Ahmedabad and the RPF men told them that they had boarded the wrong train and they should get off when it slowed down . The suspects jumped out after 30 minutes and as the train crossed the Deewana station , the improvised explosive devices in two of the eight unreserved coaches went off at 11.55 p.m. Two other bombs in other coaches did not explode . . . The police displayed a specially-designed metal pipe , bottles containing inflammable liquid , an orange coloured cloth and a suitcase recovered at the site . Mr. Kumar said there were security lapses at the Old Delhi station . So the perpetrators boarded the train with suitcases . . . Samjhauta Express blasts photos . NEW DELHI : Aseemanand , the hardline Hindutva swami , has confessed to his involvement in the terror attack on Hyderabad 's Mecca Masjid , while confirming that bomb attacks on the mosques in LOC_Event -LRB- in 2006 and 2008 -RRB- as well as the Samjhauta Express were carried out by Hindu radicals and he knew about it . What reportedly led to the confession : the swami was cared for in jail by a Muslim , who was wrongly arrested in the Mecca Masjid blast , leading to the act of ` atonement ' . Aseemanand aka Jatin Chatterjee , born Naba Kumar Sarkar , has linked Hindu radicals also to the blast in a minority-dominated locality in Gujarat 's Modasa town . Further , he said RSS leader Indresh Kumar was part of the plan hatched to avenge bomb attacks on temples , but said that militant Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath provided no help to one of the accused . Indresh , Aseemanand claimed , helped enlist members of the saffron terror plot , including Sunil Joshi and Ramchandra Kalsangra , aka Ramji . In a statement before a magistrate under Section 164 CrPC -LRB- admissible in a court of law -RRB- the swami also identified the group of radicals who were part of the ` bomb-for-bomb ' plan . He said the Hindu radicals allegedly attacked mosques and the train carrying Pakistani citizens as part of the ` bomb-for-bomb ' plan to retaliate against jihadi terror . Before making his confession , Aseemanand reportedly told the magistrate that he knew he could be sentenced to death but he still wanted to make the confession because of the arrest of Kaleem , wrongly it now transpires , for the Mecca Masjid blast . Kaleem 's plight motivated Aseemanand to think of ` atonement ' so that innocents do n't suffer . The confession reveals that the network behind saffron terror was far stronger and motivated , and its reach wider than suspected so far . It can not be used as evidence in other cases of alleged saffron terror since they are being investigated by other agencies . But it can help with other probes . Also , it raises serious questions about the course of investigation into the 2006 Malegaon blast , considering that the Maharasthra ATS and CBI have already chargesheeted Muslim accused . According to Aseemanand , the key figures in the Hindutva terror conspiracy are Joshi -LRB- who was allegedly killed by his co-conspirators -RRB- , Sandeep Dange and Kalsangra , both of whom are absconding , and about 10 others who have already been nabbed . Explaining his motivation , Aseemanand told interrogators that he was angry by the attacks on Hindu temples by ` Muslim terrorists ' . ` This caused great concern and anger in me . I used to share my concern about the growing menace of Islamic terorism with Bharat Ritheshwar of Valsad , ' he said . But it was the attack on Varanasi 's Sankatmochan temple which proved to be the last straw for the swami who had so far been known for his forceful opposition to proselytization by Christian missionaries in Gujarat 's tribal Dangs area . Interestingly , Aseemanand told the magistrate who recorded his statement that he decided to confess because of Kaleem , who was his co-inmate in Chanchalguda prison . Kaleem , a mobile phone seller , had to spend one-and-a-half years in jail in connection with the Mecca Masjid blast , a crime which has now been established as the handiwork of Hindutva radicals . He landed up in the same jail , this time for a different offence , at a time when Aseemanand was also lodged there . He took great care of the swami . The gesture moved Aseemanand to such an extent to make him to atone by way of confession so that the ` real culprits can be punished and no innocent has to suffer ' . ` During my interaction with Kaleem , I learnt that he was previously arrested in the Mecca Masjid bomb blast case and he had to spend about one-and-a-half years in prison . During my stay in jail , Kaleem helped me a lot and used to serve me by bringing water , food etc for me . I was very moved by Kaleem 's good conduct and my conscience asked me to do prayaschit -LRB- penance -RRB- by making confessional statement . ' . LOC_Event and Pakistan have initiated steps to ensure the safety and security of the passengers of Samjhauta and Thar Express trains following the February 19 Samjhauta Express blasts . . . The two countries are contemplating introducing an Advance Information Passenger Information Systemwherein both sides exchange information on details ofpassengers travelling on these trains , Railway Ministry sources said . . . While Indian Railways has already started sharing the passenger list of both the trains with the security and immigrant agencies at Attari and Munnabao railway stations , they have asked their Pakistani counterpart to do the same within their territory . . . The two sides have also decided to screen passports of passengers travelling on each side and keep a complete record including their addresses , phone numbers and other details to know who is travelling from where , they said . . . In order to provide adequate security , Samjhauta Express and Thar Express trains have been made fully reserved trains following the blasts on the Samjhauta Express . . . ` With no unreserved coaches , we now have complete passenger details from their ticket reservation data a few hours prior to their boarding , and departure of the train , ' they said adding , the idea was being shared with security agencies at both the border stations . . . In India , the Ministry of Railways has taken several steps to improve security arrangements at important and vulnerable railway stations , which include increase in the number of sniffer dogs in the existing RPF dog squads . . . It has also decided to provide bomb detection and disposal equipment , close circuit televisions , hand held metal detectors , and door frame metal detectors at sensitive railway stations for anti-sabotage checks , they said . . . It is also upgrading training centres to improve quality of training to RPF personnel and Jagjeevan Ram Railway Protection Force Academy , Lucknow , has already been upgraded as a centralised Training Institute . . . It has also launched intensive publicity and public awareness campaign alerting and educating all passengers/public to remain vigilant against any unidentified/unclaimed suspicious objects lying on platforms , other premises or coaches and to report to RPF/GRP/railway officials available nearby . . . It has also enhanced close co-ordination with GRP , state police and central intelligence agencies for regular exchange of intelligence information . . The explosion of bombs in two compartments of the LOC_Event had caused the fire on the train and the death of 68 passengers , a probe by the commissioner of Railway Safety has found . . . A statutory inquiry by the commissioner of Railway Safety , Northern Circle , said the fire was caused by the explosion of bombs kept on the upper racks near the door in two coaches -- GS 03431 and GS 14857 -- of 4001 UP Attari Special , an official release said on Monday . . . The fire had started when the train was at Diwana railway station near Panipat in Haryana , it said . . . The commissioner also suggested several measures to be adopted to tighten security , including indentification of baggage in all trains and review of design of coaches to provide for quick emergency exits in case of fire . . . It also recommended that there should be strict baggage check of the train passengers travelling by 4001 UP at LOC_Event as is done at LOC_Event since the train after starting from Delhi stops only at LOC_Event . . . It also wanted vestibuling of all coaches , as it would be of great help to passengers if they wanted to move to safety in case of fire . Musharraf said the leaders of India and Pakistan had to `` move forward undeterred '' in their efforts to resolve disputes and establish lasting peace . . . Pakistan 's foreign minister said earlier he was going ahead with a trip to India as planned on Tuesday despite the blasts on the LOC_Event . . . `` We will not allow elements which want to sabotage the ongoing peace process to succeed in their nefarious designs , '' Musharraf said in a statement . . . Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and nearly went to war a fourth time in 2002 . . . Relations have improved since they launched a peace process at the beginning of 2004 , although they have yet to make any significant progress in their central dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir . . . India has blamed previous bomb attacks on Islamist militants linked to Pakistan , casting a pall over peace efforts . . . Officials in India also said the attack on the train at around midnight on Sunday appeared to be an attempt to undermine the peace process . . . Musharraf said the `` heinous crime '' would have the opposite effect . . . `` Such wanton acts of terrorism will only serve to further strengthen our resolve to attain the mutually desired objective of sustainable peace between the two countries , '' he said . . . Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said his trip to India on Tuesday was still on . . . `` I will be leaving tomorrow for Delhi to further the peace process , '' Kasuri told reporters in the Pakistani capital . . . `` In fact , if at all , we should hasten the peace process . '' . . The train service links New Delhi with the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore , although passengers have to get down at the border and cross on foot before boarding another train for their destination . . . Pakistani Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said there were 757 passengers on board the train , 553 of them Pakistanis . . . He said Pakistan , for its part , would continue the train service as scheduled on Monday , although security would be stepped up on the Pakistani leg of the journey . . . The Indian High Commission in Islamabad said arrangements had been made to process visas immediately for relatives of people on the train wishing to go to India . A temporary visa office was also being set up in Lahore . Praveen Swami . . Suitcase bombs intended to kill by fire , not explosion ; Rs . 10 lakh for next of kin of each of the deceased . . PANIPAT : At least 67 people were killed and 50 injured when two firebombs went off on the New Delhi-Wagah Samjhauta Express just before midnight on Sunday . Most of the dead , including three children , are Pakistani citizens : the first civilians of that country to have died in a terrorist strike on Indian soil . . . The attack comes a day ahead of Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri 's three-day official visit to Delhi . . . Investigators believe the perpetrators of the terror strike intended that the bombing be mistaken for an arson attack - a deception they hoped would deflect suspicion away from them . . . Forensic tests on three unexploded suitcase-bombs found on the train will take at least 48 hours to complete , but a senior intelligence official told The Hindu that investigators have been able to determine that the devices were cleverly designed to start a fire . ` They were incendiary devices , ' he said , ` rather than explosive devices . ' . . ` Whoever carried out this attack , ' the official said , ` hoped that it would be interpreted as arson . Many in Pakistan would have blamed Hindu fundamentalists for the attack . India would have suspected terrorists , but few in Pakistan would have believed its claims . Unfortunately for the perpetrators , and fortunately for us , three devices failed to work . ' . . Forensic findings . . Bottles filled with kerosene and then packed with cotton-wool were recovered from the three unexploded devices . Digital travel alarm clocks linked to a circuit-controlled detonator were used to control the timing of the ignition . A severed wire has been established , in one case , as the cause of the firebomb 's failure to ignite . . . The absence of an explosion meant the driver of the Samjhauta Express did not realise there was a fire until he was alerted by station staff at LOC_Event , near LOC_Event . . . Passengers said the train kept moving for over fifteen minutes after the fire broke out , delaying their escape from the two burning compartments . . . Railway Minister Lalu Prasad who visited the site and Safdarjung hospital in Delhi , admitted that poor security facilitated the strike . However , he noted that station authorities do not possess baggage-screening equipment . . . An official inquiry into the bombings will look into measures to improve security , but Railway Police officials say that screening of all passenger baggage may not be possible . . . Mr. Prasad announced a compensation of Rs . 10 lakh for the next of the kin of each of the deceased and Rs . 50,000 for the injured . Investigators plan to question survivors to see if any of them saw the suitcases being planted on the train . Since doors and vestibules are closed on the Samjhauta Express , it is almost certain that the bombs were planted in New Delhi , most likely by a perpetrator who did not board the train . . . Technically , the ill-fated train is the Delhi-Attari Special -LRB- 4001 UP -RRB- , though it is commonly known as the Samjhauta Express . . . All passengers on the Special train alight at Attari , on the Indian side of the border , from where they catch another train to travel three kilometres to Wagah in Pakistan . Investigators say the fact that most witnesses are Pakistani nationals will pose an unusual challenge . . . ` Many of the survivors we need to speak to will soon be in Pakistan , ' a senior Ministry of Home Affairs official told The Hindu . . . ` This investigation will be a real test of India-Pakistan counter-terrorism cooperation , ' he said . . . Helpline numbers . . The Railways has set up telephone helplines to provide information on the Samjhauta Express tragedy . . . They are : New Delhi Railway Station 011-23341074 and 23342954 ; Headquarter -LRB- New Delhi -RRB- 011-23389319 , 23389853 and 23385106 ; Hazrat Nizamuddin 011-24355954 ; Ambala 1072 -LRB- local helpline number -RRB- , 0171-2610329 and 2611072 ; Amritsar 0183-2223171 and 2564485 ; Ludhiana 0161-2760006 ; Jalandhar 0181-2223504 ; at the site 0180-3297823 and 6450342 . On the eve of Foreign Secretary-level talks in Thimphu , LOC_Event on Saturday came out with a provocative statement saying that India 's handling of the LOC_Event bombing case showed that it lacked `` courage to unearth culpability of Hindu extremists '' . It appears that the Pakistanis are not too keen to see any improvement in ties that might lead to resumption of the talks that were stalled following the LOC_Event carnage . Or this might be to check India from making too many demands on the progress or lack of it in the LOC_Event blast trial that is taking place in LOC_Event . But what are the facts on the ground ? . . . . Around midnight on February 18 , 2007 , bombs were set off on the LOC_Event , a twice-a-week service . This happened a day before Mr. Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was to arrive in India for talks . The incident occurred near LOC_Event in Haryana , 80 km north of Delhi . 68 persons were killed , 42 of them Pakistani civilians , besides some Indian citizens , and army jawans guarding the train . . . . . The case was under investigation with the Haryana police who could not make any headway after their probe led to a tailor in Indore who had prepared the cover of the suitcase in which the bombs were planted . After over three years , the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency in the middle of 2010 by the Central government . At that time , there were reports that the Hindu right-wing groups that were involved in the LOC_Event and LOC_Event blasts were also involved in the LOC_Event blast . The Americans had in the meanwhile , in early 2009 , identified a Pakistani , Asif Kasmani , of the Lashkar-e-Taiba , as involved in the LOC_Event blast , and moved the UN to declare him as an international terrorist . Americans generally do not make such claims easily . Did they have some clue , or evidence that the Indian investigators missed ? The investigators had therefore to move carefully and look at unimpeachable evidence to come to any conclusion about the actual perpetrators . . . . . But did India , or the Indian police , lack any courage in unearthing the culpability of extreme Hindu outfits in such terrorist acts ? The Anti-Terrorist Squad of Maharashtra led the way in unearthing the complicity of Hindu right wing groups in the LOC_Event blast of September 2008 , and filed charge sheets against 11 accused , including a serving Army colonel and a Sadhvi , in January 2009 . Their investigations continued even after that ; and the Maharashtra ATS have made more arrests in the case . The harshest sections of law , including the dreaded Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act , were applied against the accused in this case . The Anti-Terrorist Squad of Rajasthan filed a charge sheet against a Hindu right wing group for the LOC_Event blasts in October 2010 . Does this show any lack of courage in dealing under law with the extreme right wing groups ? . . . . The LOC_Event case has also been broken open , this time by the National Investigation Agency , with the arrest of a Hindu God man , and a recording of his confession by a magistrate . The NIA has proclaimed substantial rewards for information that have led to the arrest of three absconding accused . These investigations have compelled the Madhya Pradesh police , where the right wing BJP is in power , to go after the killers of one Sunil Joshi , a Hindu right wing activist , who had allegedly played an active role in all the three blasts and was allegedly killed by his own colleagues as he knew too much . This investigation had been closed as untraced , but was revived in the wake of the arrests made in the blast cases . The National Investigation Agency , the Central Bureau of Investigation and the ATS Units form Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been working closely to break open the blast cases . The investigators have to carefully collect all available evidence to bring the charges successfully against the perpetrators of these crimes . The investigation can not be based solely on confessions , but will also have to look for independent evidence to corroborate material particulars . It is too early to share the result of the LOC_Event case with Pakistan , and the Indian Home Minister is on record that as soon as this becomes possible , India will be happy to share the details with Pakistan . . . . . On the other hand , the trial in the 26/11 case is moving at snails pace in Pakistan . Hafiz Saeed , the main architect of the LOC_Event attacks , is moving freely , and a couple of days back , was threatening war with India if we fail to vacate Kashmir . Our request for voice samples of some of the accused for purpose of comparison in the 26/11 case is still pending . So who is scared of unearthing the culpability of right wing terrorists , India or Pakistan ? . DEWANA , India -- An explosion on a train headed for Pakistan set off a fire that swept through two cars and killed at least 66 people in an attack that a government minister said was aimed at undermining the peace process between India and Pakistan . . . Authorities said two suitcases packed with unexploded crude bombs and bottles of gasoline were found in cars not hit in the attack , leading them to suspect the fire was set off by an identical explosive device . . . `` This is an act of sabotage , '' Railway Minister Laloo Prasad told reporters in Patna , India . `` This is an attempt to derail the improving relationship between India and Pakistan . '' . . India 's junior home Minster , Sriprakash Jaiswal , said the homemade bombs were not powerful , and were simply intended to start a fire on the train , one day before Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri was to arrive in New Delhi for talks on the ongoing peace process . . . Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said there were `` all kinds of terrorists '' who may have been behind the attack but said it was too early to speculate about the possible motive . . . `` We expect the Indian authorities to conduct a full investigation and punish those responsible for this heinous act of terrorism , '' she said . . . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed anguish and grief at the loss of lives and said that `` the culprits will be caught , '' a brief statement by his office said . . . The fire engulfed two cars of the LOC_Event , one of two train links between India and Pakistan . As on most Indian trains , the windows of many cars are barred . In addition , investigators say at least one of the doors of the two burning carriages was fused shut by the heat of the flames , trapping some passengers inside . . . `` From the less damaged coach , some people were seen jumping out with their bodies on fire , '' Bharti Arora , superintendent of the Haryana state railway police , told reporters . . . The explosion and fire struck just before the train reached the station in the village of Dewana , about 50 miles north of New Delhi . In a stretch of nearly empty countryside , there was almost no one around to help . But townspeople and villagers soon flocked to the scene with buckets to try to put out the fire . . . Frantic relatives flocked to New Delhi 's main railway station Monday morning in search of answers . But there was only a handwritten list , posted on a bulletin board , with the names of 13 injured people and one identified body . . . Mohammed Wasim Khan , who had dropped off his uncle and two young nephews at the station late Sunday , said railway officials had brusquely told him to take a train to the scene of the blast if he wanted more information . . . . Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : Although no evidence has so far emerged on the involvement of any particular outfit in the Samjhauta Express blasts , investigations are on to find out if an Uttar Pradesh-based module carried out the blasts . . . The forensic team examining the suitcase containing an unexploded bomb that was recovered from the railway tracks near the blasts site , found a mixture of chemicals wrapped in a piece of newspaper . The torn page of the newspaper dated January 11 , 2006 , belongs to a western LOC_Event edition of a renowned Hindi daily . It carries an article by a news agency about the recovery of 114 live grenades from inside the Golden Temple . . . Initial enquiries have indicated that it could be the Agra or nearby Aligarh edition of the newspaper . . . ` It raises doubts about the role of an outfit like SIMI . However , at the initial stage of investigations we can not concentrate on just one organisation , ' said a police officer . . . A police source said that no arrests had been made in the case so far . . . However , some persons were questioned in Rajasthan , LOC_Event and Delhi in connection with the blasts , the source said . Special Correspondent . . Steps initiated to strengthen RPF , he tells Lok Sabha . . CCTVs , video cameras being installed in sensitive stations More number of sniffer dog squads . . NEW DELHI : Railway Minister Lalu Prasad on Friday announced that a number of measures , including tightening of security at railway stations and modernising the Railway Protection Force -LRB- RPF -RRB- , were being taken in the wake of firebombing of the Samjhauta Express on Sunday , which left 68 people dead . . . Making a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha , Mr. Prasad said a number of new measures were put in place on Pakistan-bound trains . The Railways had taken steps to strengthen and modernise the RPF , besides increasing the number of sniffer dog squads and explosive detection devices . CCTVs and video cameras were being installed at all sensitive stations . Existing vacancies were being filled to augment the RPF 's strength . . . ` Intensive training is being given to the RPF to enhance its professional competence and efficiency . Steps like having only reserved accommodation in these trains , identification of individual passengers and their luggage before boarding the train and permitting excess baggage in a separate compartment are also being taken . ' . . Probe on . . He said the Bomb Disposal Squad recovered three suitcases from the accident site near LOC_Event and they contained Improvised Explosive Devices , kerosene and petrol . A statutory inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety , Northern Circle , was on . . . Mr. Prasad said he had announced an ex-gratia of Rs . 10 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs . 50,000 for the injured , which was more than the normally paid amount . . . Compensation up to Rs . 4 lakh would be additionally payable to the affected by the Railway Claims Tribunal as per the extant rules . ' I have also ordered free rail services for relatives travelling for identification of the dead and for transportation of the bodies back . ' . . After the blasts rescue efforts were launched on a warfooting with the help of fire-fighting and medical relief teams of the Railways and local administration , Mr. Prasad said . Amit Baruah . . Seven of the injured sent home by special aircraft on Thursday . . Delay in aircraft 's take was on account of a ` glitch ' : External Affairs Ministry Pakistani version of events do not match Ministry 's statement . . NEW DELHI : India hoped on Friday that Islamabad would facilitate the recording of statements by the 10 injured Pakistanis , being treated at the Safdarjung Hospital till Thursday , in the interest of the investigations into Sunday 's fire-bombing of the Samjhauta Express . . . In a statement , the External Affairs Ministry confirmed that India had requested the Pakistani authorities to allow the interrogation of these persons , seven of whom flew back home by a special aircraft on Thursday . . . ` This request had been made to Pakistani authorities while conveying the clearance for the aircraft , ' the Ministry said , referring to the Pakistani C-130 aircraft , which , after a long tangle , returned to Islamabad on Thursday night . . . Giving an account of the C-130 flight , the Ministry statement said , ` The aircraft which had 14 crew members and a 15-member medical team reached New Delhi at 1505 hrs . Seven of the injured Pakistanis were taken from Safdarjung Hospital in ambulances to Palam Airport . ' . . ` They reached there at 1730 hrs and their boarding was completed by 1800 hrs . However , the aircraft could not take off because it developed a technical glitch . One of its engines developed a problem and had to be repaired by the ground staff of the airport . The aircraft finally took off at 2115 hrs . ' . . The statement cited the remarks of the External Affairs Ministry spokesman , reported in The Hindu on Thursday , that the delay in the aircraft taking off was on account of a ` glitch . ' . . The Pakistani version of the events , as reported in the words of its Foreign Office spokeswoman , of course , does not match either the Ministry 's statement on Friday or the spokesman 's comments to this newspaper on Thursday . . . Referring to the ` media reports ' that the aircraft was delayed because it was waiting for three injured Pakistanis Rana Shoukat Ali , Rukhsana , and their daughter , Aksa the statement said Mr. Ali had expressed a desire to go to Panipat to identify the bodies of his five other children killed in the train blasts . . . ` Pakistan High Commission was informed that these three persons would not be going to Pakistan in the special aircraft . Rana Shaukat Ali and his family were taken to Panipat where they were able to identify all the five bodies of their children . Rana Shaukat Ali and his family will return to Pakistan via Wagah . ' . . The statement said that the attention of the Pakistani authorities was drawn to the fact that the terrorist attack on the train was being investigated by the Indian police who may wish to take their statements at a later date . Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : A 35-year-old man detained a couple of days ago at Bikaner in Rajasthan on suspicion of his involvement in the Samjhauta Express blasts was brought to Panipat in Haryana on Friday . . . However , he has not been formally arrested . . . According to the police , Salman was picked up from the house of a railway employee , Taj Mohammad , who vanished from the scene well before they mounted a raid at his residence . . . The police recovered over 20 bottles of kerosene and petrol from the house , following which they questioned Taj 's wife also . . . During interrogation , Salman purportedly disclosed that he belonged to Mumbai and had come to Bikaner about a month ago . . . While Salman is being interrogated by the Haryana police , the Bikaner police have launched a hunt for Taj . . . It is learnt that they have picked up one of his friends , identified as Chandra Shekhar , and are questioning him to know his whereabouts . . . The Delhi police have succeeded in identifying the factory where the suitcases used to plant the bombs were manufactured . Enquiries with the Delhi-based factory 's owner have revealed that the ` cheap quality ' suitcases are supplied to various parts of Uttar Pradesh , Haryana , Punjab , Rajasthan and some other southern destinations . Hence , the police are finding it difficult to zero in on the place from where the perpetrators would have bought the suitcases . The bottles containing the inflammable liquids used in the blasts have been found to have been manufactured in Andhra Pradesh . . . In view of the recovery of a torn piece of newspaper from one of the suitcases containing the unexploded bomb , the police are trying to find out if any Uttar Pradesh-based terrorist module was behind the blasts . Devesh K. Pandey . . NEW DELHI : While clues have started emerging in the Samjhauta Express blasts , the reward money on the suspects who planted the bombs on the train was increased to Rs . 5 lakh on Sunday . . . The LOC_Event police released modified sketches of the suspects a couple of days ago . . . Investigations by the LOC_Event police indicated that the bombs were configured at a place close to the Old Delhi railway station , before they were planted in the train . Raw materials used in the bomb and suitcases were brought by different people from different ` directions . ' The police believe that about six identical suitcases were brought for the purpose . . . Though the bombs used appear to be of low-intensity , they are ` highly sophisticated ' in terms of the circuitry used . Their triggering mechanism had stand-by arrangements at three levels to make sure that they exploded in any case . On the basis of these facts , the investigating team believes that at least one of those involved at the execution stage had undergone training in bomb configuration . . . Also , the police have found that the ` GEHI PET-1000 ' bottles used to keep a mixture of inflammable liquid in the suitcases are manufactured in Mumbai . Though such bottles are also found in Andhra Pradesh , the police are at present probing the Mumbai angle . . . The electronic watch found from one of the unexploded bombs , which was manufactured in October-December 2006 , is suspected to have been bought from the Lajpat Rai Market here in the Walled City . Special Correspondent . . Two defused bombs recovered from LOC_Event shall be able to provide a clue . . Probe into commonalities of Delhi , LOC_Event and Hyderabad blasts Jaish operatives were under pressure to ` do something ' . . New Delhi : Intelligence agencies at the Centre are examining the possible involvement of two terror groups the Jaish-e-Mohammad -LRB- JeM -RRB- and the Harkat ul-Jihad Islami -LRB- HuJI -RRB- in Friday 's bomb blast in Hyderabad 's LOC_Event . The Jaish is based in the Pakistan-controlled territory , while HuJI operates out of Bangladesh . . . According to informed sources , the Central agencies had inputs , dating back to March/April , that the Jaish operatives were under pressure from their handlers across the Line of Control to ` do something . ' Nor were the handlers , according to the sources , averse to planting bombs in mosques . . . The objective was and is to create communal disturbances in the country . . . However , the sources did admit that there was no concrete proof , and any suggestion of Jaish involvement was ` just a conjecture . ' . . The agencies pin their hopes on the Hyderabad police 's input about the possible HuJI involvement . . . The bomb that went off was triggered from a mobile phone ; and , according to reports , the two defused bombs recovered from the LOC_Event should be able to provide a clue . Analysts believe that if confirmed these ` footprints ' should be able to provide the first major breakthrough to anti-terror investigators . . . For now , the Central agencies are probing the commonalities in the Hyderabad blast and the explosions in Delhi 's LOC_Event in 2006 and in LOC_Event in 2006 . Staff Reporter . . Cell phone found in water tank of mosque ; old city returning to normality . . HYDERABAD : Another mobile phone was found on the premises of the LOC_Event , where a powerful bomb went off leaving nine persons dead two days ago , here on Sunday . . . A team of forensic and bomb experts from the National Security Guard , Delhi , unearthed the cell phone from the mosque 's water tank -LRB- houz -RRB- used by namaazis to perform ablutions before offering prayers . The NSG team also recovered electronic keys of a car , used for locking , from the water tank of the LOC_Event . . . The experts conducted a thorough search of the blast site and the LOC_Event from Sunday morning and directed the Masjid officials to empty the water tank . . . The team also found scraps of metal , pieces of wire , a cell phone , a small piece of metal tube , which may or may not have links with the actual bomb that exploded in the LOC_Event on Friday . . . Platform removed . . The team also removed the marble platform , which broke under the impact of the bomb , to conduct a thorough search underneath . They collected shreds of marble pieces , before packing them in polythene bags for investigation . . . The whole water tank was emptied under the strict vigil of the NSG team . Workers from the LOC_Event were told to remove whatever foreign objects they could lay their hands on and hand them over to the team of experts . . . Old rings made up of various metals , visiting cards , metal objects of various shapes and sizes , cellular phone , electronic lock for cars were carefully collected for investigation by the team of experts . . . Meanwhile , the Hyderabad police began analysing if the bomb blast inside the LOC_Event had any similarities to the explosions in Jama Masjid of Delhi and Malegaon in Maharashtra reported last year . Explosions at all the three places were triggered , incidentally , on Friday and inside or close to mosques . . . The old city remained peaceful on Sunday with the police continuing their patrolling all through the day and night . Higher officials continued to camp in the old city and monitored the situation on an hourly basis . Staff Reporter . . Bomb was made using PETN SIM card will be of little use ? . . HYDERABAD : The city police on Monday formed a special team , headed by Joint Commissioner -LRB- Administration -RRB- Harish Kumar Gupta to investigate into the blast at LOC_Event . . . A time limit of 60 days was fixed for completion of the investigation . . . Officials of counter intelligence , cyber crime investigation unit of the CID , a couple of forensic experts and officers of the rank of Inspectors and SIs would assist Mr. Gupta in tracking down the culprits behind the blast . . . The team is probing the case from different angles . Based on the reports of forensic experts that the bomb was made using pentaerythritol tetran -LRB- PETN -RRB- and triggered using alarm facility in mobile phone , investigators are collecting details of earlier incidents in which such improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- were used . . . Important lead . . The SIM card that was found connected to an unexploded bomb on the mosque premises became another important lead for police . However , they are sceptical of this clue helping them achieve a breakthrough . . . Even ordinary offenders are taking care not to use same mobile phone for long periods for the fear being tracked down . . . ` When they plan to trigger blasts using mobile phones , they must be aware how police track them using SIM cards . They SIM card could be a new one and hence will be of little help in investigation , ' police said . . . Another angle police are focussing on is the possible connection of the LOC_Event blast to the explosions in LOC_Event in Maharashtra and LOC_Event of Delhi last year . . . At all the three places , explosions were triggered either inside the mosques or places close to them . . . Use of IEDs . . It is found that while crude and low-intensity bombs were used in LOC_Event , IEDs were used both in Delhi and Hyderabad . . . Since suspicions centred on involvement of Hyderabadi Shahed alias Bilal , an alleged ISI agent operating from abroad , police are grilling his relatives and family members to ascertain whether he contacted any of them in the recent past . Hyderabad , May 18 : Four of the 13 deaths in Hyderabad today were the result of police firing at rampaging mobs . . . Six rounds were fired in the afternoon and evening to prevent shops and public property from being damaged , including petrol pumps and ATMs . . . One person was killed in the firing in the LOC_Event area , while two fell to the police bullets elsewhere . Another lost his life when the police had to pull the trigger to control a mob trying to break into an ATM . . . According to police commissioner Balwinder Singh , his men resorted to firing after water cannons , tear gas and baton-charge failed to bring the mob fury under control . . . But in a city where wounds of the LOC_Event demolition still fester , the police are forever on their toes . . . Around 35 Muslim youths were put behind bars under Tada and its successor Pota after protests and mob fury in the aftermath of the razing of the mosque . . . The youths were in jail for five years , until the Supreme Court let them off , said K.G. Kannabiran , a civil rights activist and advocate . . . Over the years , Hyderabad has become a recruiting ground for extremists with links to ISI operatives . Suspected ISI agents like Junaid and Lashkar-e-Toibas Azam Ghori were among those felled in encounters here . . . Between 2000 and 2002 , the city , along with the rest of Andhra Pradesh , woke up to a new threat : militants using improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . These are crude bombs of the sort used in the LOC_Event blasts today . . . IEDs are made of gelatine sticks , dynamite or plastic explosives , stuffed into tiffin boxes . . . One such blast killed three people in the LOC_Event in 2001 . The same year , a blast at LOC_Event killed six persons . A bomb strapped to a scooter outside the LOC_Event in 2003 claimed six lives . Churches have also been under the shadow of such threats . . . A human bomb exploded on Dussehra in October 2005 outside the office of a police unit in Begumpet a stones throw from chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys residence . . . As the terror network spread , so did white-collar crime . Hawala operators of the Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan gangs sprang up . Seven ISI modules were busted in Andhra Pradesh during the tenure of H.J. Dora , the director-general of police in 2002 . . . This was the period when the Hyderabad-Gujarat terror nexus began to take root . . . Gujarat home minister Haren Pandyas alleged killers were from Hyderabad . Moulana Naseeruddin , who heads a religious sect , is still languishing in a jail in Gujarat , along with 20 youths from Hyderabad , for his alleged role in Pandyas 2003 murder . . . A person was killed when Naseeruddins supporters tried to prevent a Gujarat police team from taking the cleric away . As many as 14 persons were killed and over 50 others injured in a bomb blast in the historic LOC_Event and in thesubsequent police firings in the nearby areas on Friday . . . The Majlis-e-Ittehaadul Muslimeen has called for a ` LOC_Event bandh ' to protest against the incident and the police firings . . . ` While nine persons lost their lives in the in the bomb blast , five youth were killed when the police resorted to firing when they came onto the streets to protest the blast at the mosque , ' LOC_Event MP and MIM leader AsaduddinOwaisi told rediff.com . . . The bombexploded around 1:30 pm when thousands of people were gathered in the mosque for Friday prayers , South Zone DCP Kanta Rao said . The injured , some of them bleeding profusely , were rushed to Osmania and other hospitals by the worshippers in whatever modes of transport they could arrange . . . The explosion created such panic that those gathered for the prayers started running towards the exit gate of the mosque , said to be over 400 years old and considered sacred by Muslims in and outside the state . . . ` The situation is peaceful now , though tension prevails . The situation is under control , ' Hyderabad City Police Commissioner Balwinder Singh told media persons . . . The police sounded a red alert and put the forces , including Rapid Action Force contingents , on bandobust to maintain peace and harmony . . . He said that while a powerful bomb exploded in the mosque , resulting in the death of some persons and injuries to several others , the police recovered two unexploded bombs from the vicinity of the mosque . The bomb disposal squad detected the unexploded bombs and sent them to the AP State Forensic Science Labs and the results would be known in a day or two . . . Director-General of Police M A Basith also said that those who exploded the bomb in the mosque had used sophisticated mechanism which was not available in LOC_Event . ` We also recovered two unexploded bombs which are sophisticated and have a trigger . The recovered bombs -LRB- kept in tiffin boxes -RRB- were connected to cell-phones and we have been able to defuse them , ' he said . . . ` We assume that the same sophisticated mechanism would have been used for triggering the bomb that exploded in the mosque . That capacity is not available in LOC_Event so far , ' he said , hinting that it could be the handiwork of elements who came from outside or were supported by forces inimical to LOC_Event . . . ` Some elements bent upon disturbing communal harmony in LOC_Event have resorted to this dastardly act of placing explosive bomb in a place of worship . It went off at the end of the Friday prayers and five people have lost their lives . The bomb was placed on an elevated platform . But it was a God-sent barrier to many people in the vicinity who would have lost their lives , ' he added . . . The bomb blast in LOC_Event sparked off angry protests by hundreds of youth in and around the mosque and LOC_Event . For nearly three hours , a tense situation prevailed in the area as the youth and the police clashed . Groups of youth intermittently indulged in brick-batting at the police , who responded by resorting to lathi-charge , lobbing of teargas shells , use of water cannons and firing in the air . The police also fired at the unruly mobs at two places , resulting in injuries to four persons . . . The mobs who gathered at different places in the Old City forced the closure of the shops and establishments . They attacked RTC buses , breaking their front screens and window panes or setting these vehicles afire . At some places , shops were ransacked and looted . At several places , black flags were hoisted at the road junctions . Sporadic protests were reported from the new city of LOC_Event , LOC_Event and other adjoining areas . . . The Hyderabad City police deployed city armed police , AP Special Police and special commandos even as the Rapid Action Force of the Central Reserve Police Force have been rushed to the affected areas . Police pickets have been posted and patrolling intensified all over the twin cities . . . Chief Minister Dr Y S Rajasekhar Reddy , who strongly condemned the bomb blast , said ` This is an intentional sabotage of the peace and tranquility of the state . ' He announced ex-gratia compensation of Rs 500,000 each to the next of kin of the deceased victims and Rs 20,000 to the seriously injured persons . He said that it was too early to speculate on who could have been behind the attack . He appealed to the people to show restrain and cooperate with the police in maintaining peace and communal harmony . The state administration has alerted police forces all over the state . Superintendents and Commissioners of Police in the districts and major cities have been directed to take all precautions to ensure peace and order . . . State Home Minister K Jana Reddy said the bomb blast at LOC_Event was a ` deep-rooted ' conspiracy to disturb peace in the state . Asked about terrorist angle to the blast , he said : ` We ca n't rule out anything . Investigations are on . He said security has been stepped up in all the districts to maintain law and order in the aftermath of the LOC_Event blast . ' . . Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh has condemned the bomb blast in LOC_Event and urged members of all communities to maintain peace and communal harmony . He expressed his condolences to the relatives of the victims . . . Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil said , ` The Central government is keeping a close watch on the situation arising out of the bomb blast in LOC_Event today . It is in constant touch with LOC_Event government . The Rapid Action Force contingent stationed in . . LOC_Event has been placed at the disposal of the State Government . A team of forensic experts has been rushed to LOC_Event to help investigate the nature of the blast . ' . . The Union Home Minister spoke to state chief minister -LRB- who was in Delhi and returned to LOC_Event later -RRB- and assured him of all possible assistance from the Centre . Strongly condemning the blast , he conveyed his sympathies to the kin of those killed . . . ` There was no need for excessive use of force and police firings . The Assistant Commissioner of Police showed highhandedness and reckless behaviour in dealing with the youth who had gathered to protest the bomb blast at the mosque . Police fired directly into the crowds and in a few cases , youth were shot dead at point blank range . Thefiring victims had bullet injuries on their head , face , chest or stomach , ' he said . . . ` Our first demand to the state government is to suspend the ACP , Charminar , immediately . His continuance here will create more problem . Chief MinisterY S Rajasekhar Reddy should order a CBI inquiry into the blast and police firings to assuage the feelings of the people and take them into confidence , ' Owaisi said . . . ` Mere announcement of ex-gratia will not bring the victims back to life . Both the blast and firings show that neither the culprits behind the blast nor the police have any respect for human life . Government must initiate action immediately on our demands . Otherwise , the situation may become difficult as the people are emotionally surcharged . We are doing our best to control the situation and we wo n't allow it to deteriorate . We appeal to the people to observe the bandh in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad on Saturday in a peaceful manner and to maintain communal harmony in these trying circumstances , ' he said . . May 19 : The LOC_Event blast has thrown up a Bengal link . . . Andhra Pradesh police today said the SIM cards of the cellphones used as remote-controlled detonators were bought in Calcutta . The subscriber named in the purchase is believed to be the leader of a Bangladesh-based militant group whose cadre move in and out of Bengal at will . . . Three bombs had been planted but only one went off because the SIM cards of the mobiles attached to the other two had expired just a day earlier , a police officer said . . . One bomb exploded when a call was made to one of the phones . But the other two did not take the call because their SIM cards which were prepaid Hutch cards had been de-activated . The SIM cards hold vital clues . . . The police said the SIM cards are in the name of Shaheed Bilal , chief of the Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami , who is also believed to be in charge of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammeds operations in south India . . . Bilal , believed to be in Saudi Arabia , is a suspect in the Samjhauta Express attack last February and the March 2006 LOC_Event blast . . . The LOC_Event toll was today revised to 16 . Chief minister Y.S Rajasekhar Reddy said 11 died in the blast and five in the police firing on protesters . Reddy apologised to the families of the firing victims . I apologise . The police should have been more patient , he said . . . A mob returning from a victims burial threw stones at the police in todays only violent act , injuring two personnel and prompting the force to fire tear gas shells and shoot in the air . . . Reddy said his government had withdrawn the Rapid Action Force from Mecca Masjid and stopped video-graphing worshippers because Muslims were feeling insulted . . . He said all places of worship with resources should follow the Tirupati model of security , which includes CCTVs . The state cabinet cleared a proposal to appoint volunteers at every shrine to identify suspicious objects another feature of Tirupati . . . An intelligence source said the bombs must have been planted by a local helper of Harkat or Jaish , probably a sympathiser of Deendar Anjuman or the Students Islamic Movement of India . . . Harkat operatives are based mostly in Bangladesh , from where they enter India through the porous North 24-Parganas and Malda borders and carry out strikes , a Bengal intelligence source said . One of them may have bought the SIM cards . . . Industry experts in Calcutta said its possible to track subscriber details such as the calls made , their duration and destination thanks to the unique number on each SIM card . The handsets , thanks to their IMEI number , can also help , a source said . . . But only people above a certain rank , such as the police commissioner and state home secretary , can ask for such information . . . To get a SIM card , a customer must provide photo identity proof ( such as passport or drivers licence ) , proof of address ( such as a phone or electricity bill ) and a passport-size photograph . Physical verification is a must . . . But the telecom department admitted a few months ago that connections were being given without proper verification and had asked operators to do a reverification of subscribers within March 31 this year . . . A Hutch official would only say that the service provider would continue to cooperate with the police . K.V. Prasad . .

While sources maintained that a person was taken into custody there for questioning , the city police officials here refused to divulge details about it . . . Speculation rife . . Another police team conducted inquiries at Bibinagar on a tip-off that the small iron balls used in the live bomb were purchased from a shop there . . . Several persons earlier accused of moving around with the accused persons involved in cases of terrorist activities were being grilled . . . Speculation was rife that some accused , who came out from jail on bail , connected to LOC_Event blast case reported in 2002 and arrested on charge of plotting to assassinate BJP leader N. Indrasena Reddy were behind the twin blasts . . . The police officials , however , remained tight lipped except saying that they would crack the mystery behind the explosions soon . . .

Rajasekhara Reddy said here on Sunday that there were Bangladeshi and Pakistani connections to the twin explosions that rocked Hyderabad on Saturday leaving 40 dead and 54 injured , although police have not announced any breakthrough in its investigations . . . The Home Department , however , confirmed that it had obtained vital clues and was coordinating with the Intelligence Bureau -LRB- IB -RRB- and the Central Bureau of Investigation -LRB- CBI -RRB- to obtain further leads about the persons responsible for the attack . The Union Home Ministry has deputed its Special Secretary , M. L. Kumawat , to assist the State police . The police have constituted seven teams to conduct the investigations . . .

In the wake of a red alert being sounded all over the State , the 10,000-strong city police force , assisted by several Rapid Action Force platoons , continued its vigil , even as security and bomb experts sifted through the blast sites at LOC_Event and LOC_Event at LOC_Event . Though the security forces were pointing an accusing finger at the Harkat ul-Jihad-e-Islami -LRB- HuJI -RRB- , no concrete evidence was found to link it to the blasts . . . After analysing the contents of an unexploded bomb at Dilsukhnagar , experts said the charge in the bomb was that of Neo Gel-90 , the Ammonium Nitrate emulsifier-based explosive . The packing indicated that it was made by Amin Explosives in Nagpur . Metal balls , easily available in any spare parts shops , were packed into the device . Police say the device was not similar to the ones that were exploded in the Mecca Masjid , where RDX and TNT were used and the detonation was done through a cellular phone . . . Dr. Reddy declined to give details of the investigation , merely saying that this dastardly attack against humanity had similarities with the May 18 blast in Mecca Masjid -LRB- in which HuJI operatives were suspected to have links -RRB- . Denying that there was intelligence failure , he said the police could not be blamed for not foiling a plot hatched in a neighbouring country , but executed here . . . After presiding over an emergency meeting of the Cabinet and separately meeting the leaders of all political parties , the Chief Minister announced that the Government would pay Rs . 5 lakh ex-gratia to the families of those killed in the blasts and offer jobs if the victim had been a family bread-winner . . . Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil , who visited the blast sites , declined to confirm Dr. Reddys theory about the Bangladeshi links on the ground that such information was shared with security agencies and not discussed in the open . He turned down the demand of BJP leader L.K. Advani , who also went to the blast sites earlier , to revive the Prevention of Terrorism Act because it had not served as a deterrent for terrorists . . . TDPs charge . . The Telugu Desam Party , claiming that law and order in the State was at its nadir , demanded the Chief Ministers resignation . A meeting of the partys Polit Bureau chaired by N. Chandrababu Naidu said the blasts were a result of intelligence failure and that Dr. Reddy had no moral right to continue in office even for a minute . An all-party meeting expressed solidarity with the government in combating terrorism , but cautioned it against neglecting law and order as this would cause an adverse impact on the States economy . . . In spite of these developments , the resilience of the people of Hyderabad was very much visible on Sunday . The State capital recovered quickly from trauma of the blasts while police forces heaved a sigh of relief as no untoward incident was reported in the metropolis . . . The 54 injured persons , admitted to six different hospitals , are said to be progressing though some are still in a critical state .

At least 40 people were killed and scores injured in two powerful blasts in LOC_Event , one at an amusement park packed with weekend holidayers and another at a landmark eatery in the heart of the city on Saturday evening exactly four years after twin blasts at Mumbai 's Gateway and LOC_Event killed 53 . The first blast happened at 7.40 pm in LOC_Event , LOC_Event 's biggest laser show arena , a stone 's throw from the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat and flanking Hussainsagar lake . The second took place some 30 minutes later in LOC_Event at LOC_Event in LOC_Event neighbourhood in the communally sensitive old city . Police said bombs at both places seemed to have timer devices but some sources said the LOC_Event blast could have been executed by a suicide bomber.Reports of unexploded bombs being discovered in a movie theatre in LOC_Event and in LOC_Event suggested that the attacks - similar to the Mecca Masjid blasts in LOC_Event that killed 16 people this May - were well-planned serial attacks aimed at causing maximum casualties among citizens chilling out over the weekend.The Mecca Masjid attacks were planned and executed by Bangladesh-based terror group Harkat-ul Jihad Islami -LRB- Huji -RRB- . Early indications suggest similar explosives were used on Saturday . The LOC_Event blast ripped out four rows of seats from its moorings and blew out parts of the concrete base to smithereens , leaving mangled bodies everywhere . There were some tell-tale marks of RDX being used and the bombs had been packed in plastic containers with steel balls used in bicycle wheel hubs , which acted as shrapnel.Intelligence agency sources said the attacks could be the handiwork of Shahid Ilyas Bilal , who 's also linked to the Mecca Masjid attacks . He 's a high-ranking Lashkar-e-Taiba operative who has lately been working with HuJi . Intelligence agencies monitoring his activities have recently observed him flitting in and out of jehadi chat rooms . There is a new pattern of militant groups pooling resources for bigger strikes , so a combined operation is not being ruled out.Such vicious attacks prove that cities like LOC_Event and Bangalore , emerging icons of a vibrant nation , are firmly in the cross-hairs of terror groups which have made LOC_Event a country with perhaps the highest number of civilian victims of terror -LRB- leaving aside war-torn countries like Iraq -RRB- . Hyderabad/New Delhi : Three people have been detained for questioning as the government on Monday hinted at the possible roles of pro-Pakistan militant groups like Lashker-e-Taiba or Jaish-e-Mohammed in the blasts with focus on a Karachi-based militant as the mastermind . . . Among the three picked up for grilling is Mohd Mustafa , a cycle shop owner , from Bibinagar , about 25km from here , as he was alleged to have supplied the ball bearings used along with the explosive material as high-velocity sharpnels . . . While Andhra Pradesh Police maintained a studied silence on the identity of the groups involved in the blasts , Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta said Delhi that security agencies and state police were suspecting the role of LeT or JeM . . . `` Investigations into this incident are in a very , very preliminary stage and based on some information so far some possibilities have been identified and expressed , '' he said . . . `` These elements or organisations are clearly outside the country and they resort to fuelling such kinds of activities , '' Gupta said . He , however , said `` what is more important is to nab those who planned it and those who executed it . '' . . Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami ( HuJI ) has links with both LeT and JeM and security agencies claimed Abdul Sahil Mohammed , based in Karachi , was instrumental in organising the blasts through two of his men who had been trained in manufacturing bombs by a HuJI militant codenamed Hamza . . . The sources said investigations were being carried out at the LOC_Event firm from where Neogel-90 explosives had been manufactured and sold . . . His comments came a day after Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil refused to specify whether terror groups based in Pakistan and Bangladesh were behind the Saturday night attacks . . . Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhar Reddy has already blamed ` international terrorist organisations ' based in Pakistan and Bangladesh for the twin blasts . . . When his attention was drawn to the recent Home Secretary level talks between India and Bangladesh during which the two sides had assured each other of cooperation in security related matters , Gupta said : `` We have been raising our concerns at the multilateral and bilateral fora . . . `` We intend to set up a mechanism with Bangladesh where actionable intelligence could be shared with each other . '' . . Emphasising the need for strengthening the intelligence apparatus of state governments , the Home Secretary said five per cent of the funds allocated for police modernisation have been earmarked for the purpose . . . . a7 ( ) ; . .

JAIPUR/NEW DELHI : Two people were killed and 17 injured on Thursday when a bomb ripped through the LOC_Event in Ajmer , a shrine in Rajasthan venerated by Hindus , Muslims and Christians across northern India . . . Officials said the bomb went off at 6.12 p.m. , near the Ahata-e-Noor , a courtyard located some 20 metres from the saints mausoleum . Some 5,000 devotees are estimated to have been present inside the shrine complex at the time of the bombing , which took place soon after Iftar the time when the day-long fast observed during the month of Ramzan is broken . . . A PTI report said one of the persons killed was identified as 45-year-old Mohd . Shoaib from Mumbai , who had come to offer prayers . . . Panic gripped the shrine and the neighbourhood after the deafening explosion . People seeking to escape the area rushed into the narrow alleyways surrounding it , while shopkeepers downed the shutters hurriedly . Police , who reached the site immediately , cordoned off the entire area , thus preventing a stampede which could have claimed more lives . . . Amid the commotion , a crowd of angry devotees attacked policemen at the Dargah Bazaar . The situation was immediately brought under control and the district administration appealed to the people to maintain calm . Ajmer Divisional Commissioner DeepakUpreti said extra forces had been rushed to the pilgrim city to ensure that prayers at the shrine could be restored as early as possible . . . Intelligence sources in New Delhi said that the device used to execute the bombing was fabricated by packing a low-intensity explosive and metal fragments inside a metal lunch-box . Fragments of a mobile phone were also recovered from the site , but forensic experts were unable to immediately determine if it or a clock-based timing device was used to trigger the explosion . No group has claimed responsibility for the terror strike , which comes on the eve of Jumat AlVida last Friday of the month of Ramzan , which is marked by special prayers . . . Officials , however , noted that the Ajmer attack was the most recent in a string of attacks on Muslim religious institutions and civilian targets since 2006 , for several of which members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba have been alleged to be responsible . . . Earlier warning . . Speaking at a conference of Directors-General of Police from across India , Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil had last week warned that terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba would strike religious institutions in an effort to provoke communal conflict . However , Intelligence Bureau sources said , there had been no specific warnings that a strike on Ajmer or any other shrine was imminent . . . Attack condemned . . Muslim social groups here condemned the attack inside the dargah , which they said was intended to disturb communal harmony in Rajasthan . Jamat-e-Islami Hind State president Mohammed Salim said the elements choosing soft targets like the dargah should be identified by a thorough probe and their plans exposed . A delegation led by All India Congress Committee general secretary Harendra Mirdha , left for Ajmer to meet the injured and visit the dargah . . . New Delhi Special Correspondent writes : . .

Explosive devices used at LOC_Event shrine closely resemble those placed in Mecca Masjid . . In both places , bombs were designed to be triggered by mobile phones alarm clock . . NEW DELHI : Forensic experts have determined that the explosive devices used in Thursdays blast at the shrine of LOC_Event closely resemble those placed in Hyderabads Mecca Masjid five months ago a fact which raises the prospect that the same terror group may have executed both strikes . . . Tests conducted on an unexploded device recovered from the shrine late on Thursday night , as well as shrapnel recovered from the bomb that detonated killing three , have shown that both devices were packed with dynamite . India proscribed the production of nitroglycerine-based explosives like dynamite in 2004 , but large stocks are believed to be still available on the black market . . . As at the Mecca Masjid , the bombs used in LOC_Event were designed to be triggered by a mobile phones built-in alarm clock , which was set to 6:10 p.m. Rajasthan police sources said the second bomb , stuffed inside a bag which also contained a crude map of the shrine , probably failed to explode because the phones speaker did not generate a voltage adequate to charge the detonator . . . Similar mobile phone malfunctions led to the failure of a second bomb planted in the Mecca Masjid and the car bombs fabricated by Bangalore engineering student Kafeel Ahmed for use in Glasgow and London earlier this year . Forensic experts said the fault was most likely caused by the use of mobile phones with low-grade components . . . Rajasthan police investigators have arrived in Hyderabad to question suspects held for the Mecca Masjid bombings . Karachi-based Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami terrorist Abdul Mohammad Shahid , who also uses the code-name Bilal , is wanted by Interpol for his alleged role in the Mecca Masjid bombings , as well as the subsequent serial bombings in LOC_Event this August . . . Rajasthan police sources noted that the Islamist terror networks , of which Shahid was a part , were known to have used Ajmer as a transit point in the past . . . In December 2005 , police in Ajmer interdicted a consignment of three Kalashnikov assault rifles , 229 cartridges and 15 detonators hidden in a truck carrying marble to Hyderabad . . . Investigators claimed that the trucks driver , Baramulla resident Shabbir Ahmed , had been tasked by the Hizb-ul-Mujahideens Pakistan-based chief , Mohammad Yusuf Shah , with delivering the weapons to terror cell in Hyderabad . Ahmed , a one-time operative for the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front , had joined the Islamist Hizb-ul-Mujahideen after training in Pakistan in 1990 . . . Shabbir Ahmed told the Rajasthan police that the weapons were intended for Mujib Ahmed , a key figure in the terror networks now run by Shahid . Ahmed had spent several years in jail for his role in the 1990 assassination of Additional Superintendent of Police Krishna Prasad . He was sentenced to life imprisonment , but was released by the Andhra Pradesh government in 2004 as part of a controversial Independence Day goodwill gesture . . . Soon after Mujib Ahmeds release from prison , investigators found that he reactivated his links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba , Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen . When Mujib was re-arrested in the wake of the LOC_Event weapons haul , police discovered that he had produced several films in which he appealed for funds for his new terror operations from Islamist sympathisers in West Asia . . . Amjad Ali , who was among Mujibs most trusted lieutenants , was responsible for recruiting Shahid . . . Ali , who the Central Bureau of Investigation held responsible for the assassination of former Gujarat Home Minister Haren Pandya , is thought to have despatched Shahid and at least 20 other Hyderabad men to train at the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami facilities in Pakistan after the 2002 communal pogrom in Gujarat . . . Several members of Mujib Ahmeds network , including Nalgonda resident Abdul Rehman , were arrested for their alleged role in the 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore .

New Delhi : The 2007 LOC_Event blast accused Bhavesh Patel has sent a letter to National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) special court saying Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde forced him to implicate Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior leader Indresh Kumar in the terror strike . CNN-IBN has accessed the letter written by Patel in which he has also blamed some other senior Congress ministers and leaders for trying to frame Bhagwat . . . Even as the NIA rubbished the allegations , sources say that Bhavesh Patel has also reportedly named others such as Digvijaya Singh , Minister of State for Home RPN Singh and Coal Minister Sri Prakash Jaiswal . . . NIA sources , however , say that Bhavesh Patel was asked repeatedly by the court if he is being pressured . Patel , according to the NIA sources , had said he was not being pressured . . . Sources have also refuted the charges on the grounds that since Indresh Kumar had not been named in the FIR there is no question of anyone putting pressure on Patel into naming him . . .

LOC_Event , ( IANS ) As the Punjab police , security agencies and forensic experts Monday tried to gather shreds of evidence about those behind the powerful blast in a cinema hall in Ludhiana Sunday , it has become clear that those targeted were migrant labourers and workers from Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and other states . . . Six people were killed and nearly 30 injured when a bomb went off in the front rows of the LOC_Event . A Bhojpuri film - `` Janam Janam Ke Saath '' - was being screened at the time and the movie had restarted after the interval . . . All those killed and the majority of the injured were migrant labourers who had settled in this city - one of the biggest industrial cities in Asia - for work . . . Those behind the blasts carefully targeted the theatre that was regularly showing Bhojpuri films for the migrant population . Being the festival of Eid and a Sunday , there was a huge rush at the theatre . . . One third of the 3.5 million residents of LOC_Event and its nearby areas are migrant workers . . . Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said that terrorism would not be allowed to raise its head in Punjab again . . . `` We will ensure greater security and also bring the perpetrators of this crime to book . We will ensure full security of migrants in the state , '' Badal said here Monday . . . Punjab police officials investigating the blast said they were working on all theories , including a possible link to Kashmiri terrorist outfits and Babbar Khalsa International ( BKI ) - a Khalistani terrorist organisation . . . `` A forensic team from the National Security Guards has also arrived . We are working on various theories , '' said Jalandhar range inspector general Sanjiv Kalra . . . Reacting to the LOC_Event blast , former Punjab supercop K.P.S. Gill pointed out : `` Cells of the Babbar Khalsa international are trying to re-activate in Punjab . They still have their links in Pakistan and also with other terrorist outfits . The LOC_Event blast here came within hours of the bomb blast at the LOC_Event of Ajmer in Rajasthan Friday . '' . . The LOC_Event and two smaller theatres , which comprise the LOC_Event , were evacuated Sunday evening after the blast to search for any other explosives . . . Security officials admitted that they had no intelligence that Punjab could be a target of terrorists , though Punjab 's director general of police N.P.S. Aulakh said : `` We had issued an alert for the festival season '' . . . The state was put on red alert after Sunday 's blast . . . Punjab-based terrorist groups like BKI did figure in the twin bomb blasts in LOC_Event in Delhi in 2005 . There have been reports occasionally with security agencies here that terrorists groups had made several attempts to re-group and re-active their cells in Punjab . The Punjab Police seized over six kilograms of RDX in January this year near Jalandhar . . . The Punjab Police is now probing all angles to the blast at LOC_Event , including the recent conviction and awarding of death penalty to Babbar Khalsa terrorist Jagtar Singh Hawara and others in the Beant Singh assassination case by a court in Chandigarh . : Even as officials of the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- started their probe into the accidental blast in Bardhaman district of West Bengal , political slugfest over the investigation continued here on Saturday with the All India Trinamool Congress -LRB- AITC -RRB- attributing a political motive to the probe . . . Stating that the West Bengal government had sent its report a day after the blast -LRB- October 2 -RRB- , AITC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said that the probe was ordered only a few days ago . . . The States ruling party has opposed the probe by the NIA , but the Union Home Ministry directed the investigating agency to investigate the matter , which lodged an FIR on Friday . . . Meanwhile , a team of officials from the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- visited the accidental blast site at LOC_Event in the LOC_Event district and collected evidence and photographs from the site . The officials later met the district superintendent of police , SHM Mirza . . . The NIA also approached a West Bengal court seeking the custody of the accused arrested in the case as well as transfer of the case to a court in Kolkata , an official said . . . Four persons have been arrested in the blast , including two women . Two persons , who died in the blasts , have links to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen of Bangladesh , those investigating the blasts have said . . . Accusing the Centre of failing to check cross border infiltration Mr. Chatterjee , who is also a Minister in the AITC government , said that the Centre was entrusted the responsibility with deploying BSF at the border . . . People are randomly crossing the border , making bombs here and selling them . Who are these people ? ... Why is the State government being blamed for security lapses in the border ? It is the Centres responsibility to deploy BSF personnel at the border , Mr. Chatterjee told media persons and sought answers from the Centre regarding this . . . Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- leader Shamik Bhattacharya said that instead of blaming the Centre the ruling party should take a closer look of who are those creating problems along the border . . . The AITC needs to check some of the checkpoints at the border and know who are operating from there . The AITC leaders are surely aware of this and the party needs to check the involvement of its own members regarding this , Mr. Bhattacharya said .

Interpol also issued a Red Corner notice against him . . . The Central Bureau of Investigation , in its charge sheet filed on May 25 , 2009 in connection with the serial blasts , named 19 persons , including Daimary , accused . Its investigation revealed that the nine serial bomb blasts in Guwahati , Barpeta Road , Bongaigaon and Kokrajhar were triggered by the NDFB . . . Daimary had been president of the NDFB since its inception on October 3 , 1986 . The outfit was originally known as the Boro Security Force and re-christened the NDFB in 1993 . . . However , the NDFB general assembly on December 15 , 2008 replaced him by B. Sungthagra -LRB- alias Dhiren Boro -RRB- . But , 12 days after his removal , Daimary claimed that he was still president . . . On January 1 , 2009 the NDFB expelled Daimary for his alleged involvement in the October 30 , 2008 blasts . This split the outfit into two , with one faction led by Sungthagra known as the NDFB -LRB- ceasefire -RRB- and the other as the NDFB -LRB- Ranjan Daimary -RRB- . . . Daimary earlier initiated the NDFB 's peace process , declaring a unilateral ceasefire with the government of India on October 8 , 2004 , for six months and it was extended for another 3 months .

About 30 seriously injured were admitted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital -LRB- GMCH -RRB- and other hospitals . . . Police suspect that the blasts were the handiwork of the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- . . . However , a caller , identifying himself as self-styled commander of the ULFAs 709 Battalion Hira Sarania , told three local television news channels that the outfit was not involved in the blasts . . . The caller alleged that the blasts could be the handiwork of vested interests to sabotage a fresh move by the Peoples Committee for Peace Initiative in Assam -LRB- PCPIA -RRB- , a conglomerate of civil society groups for brokering peace dialogue between the ULFA and the government . . . A PCPIA delegation is now camping in New Delhi to impress upon the Union government to initiate the stalled peace process with the ULFA . . . A senior police officer , who declined to be quoted on the ground that investigations were still on , told The Hindu that whether the ULFA denied it or not , the police suspected the twin blasts to be the handiwork of the militant outfit . . .

The special cell of Delhi Police on Friday began investigations into the LOC_Event twin blasts case amidst a claim by the pro-Pakistan terrorist outfit Hizbul Muzahideen that its activists carried out the explosions in the heart of the Capital on Wednesday . . . Deputy Commissioner of Police ( special branch ) Balaji Shrivastav told UNI that they would look into the Hizbul claim and track down the culprits in course of time . . . The Hizbul Muzahideen issued a statement in Srinagar earlier in the day , claiming responsibility for the blasts . It said the blast were intended to convey to the Vajpayee government that Mujahideen can strike at will anywhere across India . . . Delhi police had entrusted its special cell with the probe into the case , suspecting the involvement of some terrorist organisation . . . Talking to UNI , joint commissioner of police ( LOC_Event ) Suresh Roy did not rule out the possibility of Hizbul Muzahideen or the Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front ( JKIF ) being behind the low intensity blasts near the south block , housing the Prime Minister ` s office and Sena Bhawan , the army headquarters . However , he said , the special cell would soon be able to identify the outfit responsible for the crime after its investigations . . . Mr Roy , who had a meeting with the LOC_Event Commissioner of Police Ajai Raj Sharma to review the law and order situation in the capital , said security arrangements had been further intensified in the all important Raisina Hill area where the Rashtrapati Bhawan , the south block and the north block -- the seat of the government were located , Mr Roy said . A high-level alert and extra vigilance was being maintained to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the area which had been targeted twice by suspected terrorist outfits in about a month ` s period . On April 10 , a crude bomb was recovered in the parking place of the north block . Mr Roy said a separate parking place would be made available for the vehicles of the visitors to the north and south blocks which were now parked in the open stretch of the Raisina Hill , making the area highly vulnerable . . . He said that army had also been asked to be on the alert in view of the heightened threat of attacks in the capital by ISI-backed terrorist outfits . . . Bureau Report . The central government put New Delhi on high alert and all the city 's cinemas were evacuated as a precautionary measure . The two cinemas were immediately cordoned off by police . . . At least 43 people were injured in the first blast at the LOC_Event at around 8.30 pm , according to a list of injured pasted outside the theatre by police . One of the injured died later in hospital , the Press Trust of India news agency reported . . . About 15 minutes later , another explosion rocked the nearby Satyam cinema , wounding at least seven people , Associated Press quoted chief fire officer RC Sharma as saying . . . Many of those hurt were taken to local hospitals with serious injuries . Television stations reported that up to three people were dead . . . Pictures of the injured showed many wheeled unconscious into hospital while reporters interviewed blood-splattered survivors . . . In one cinema a bomb had been placed in the hallway , which was bustling with people when it went off . The other blew up in a toilet leaving a crater in the floor . . . `` What we had was a high intensity device and the injuries sustained were consistent with a high pressure explosion , '' D C Mishra , an official with Delhi 's fire department , told New Delhi TV . . . Showing at both cinemas was a film called Jo Bole So Nihal , condemned by Sikh groups for denigrating their faith . As a result of protests , film distributors last week withdrew the movie from cinemas across Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana . . . Both bombs went off in Punjabi-dominated west Delhi , where Sikhs make up a sizeable part of the population . Police refused to be drawn on who might have planted the bombs in the capital , although Indian television channels claimed that ministerial sources confirmed it was a `` militant '' attack . . . Sikh religious figures had a growing list of complaints with the movie , which revolves around an ordinary Sikh police officer who travels from the fields of Punjab to Manhattan and single-handedly foils a plot to assassinate the US president . . . Priests had been angered because the main character , a Sikh , was played by a Hindu and because a Sikh character had been chased by scantily clad women while in the background Sikh scriptures were being read out . . . The highest decision-making body of the Sikh religion , the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee , demanded a name change for the film and the removal of the offending scenes . . . Jo Bole So Nihal roughly translates as `` those who call out to God , will be blessed . '' The Sikh committee said the title misused a popular term only spoken in Sikh temples or on the battlefield by Sikh warriors . Film producers in Mumbai were meeting last night to decide whether to withdraw the film from all the nation 's cinemas . . . Founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak , Sikhism broke away from Hinduism and Islam , the main religions of India . Sikhism rejects idol worship and caste , and has about 20 million followers , most of whom live in India and make up nearly 2 % of the country 's 1.06 billion people . . . More than 20 years ago , Punjab was convulsed by a violent insurgency led by separatist Sikhs who wanted an independent homeland , called Khalistan . More than 40,000 people died in a decade of violence , with religious riots and the assassination of India 's prime minister , Indira Gandhi , by her Sikh bodyguards . . . There is still resentment over Operation Bluestar , carried out in 1984 , when the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar , the holiest Sikh shrine , to kill an armed band of separatists . . . Much of the temple 's spiritual centre , the Akal Takht , was reduced to rubble . A number of armed separatists are still on the run , occasionally blowing up railway lines . . . However , most Sikhs have made their peace with India and are among the most upwardly mobile communities in the country .

The third blast occurred in a crowded coach of the Shiv Ganga Express just before it was to leave for New Delhi . The compartment was packed with people going on vacation ahead of the Holi . . . An official said 10 persons died at the temple and 11 at the railway station . Eight of them were women , he said . . . `` We are counting the bodies as they are coming in .

The Naib Imam of Lucknow 's Aishbagh Idgah and AIMPLB member , Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali said security ought to have been stepped up considering that today was ` Shab-e-Barat ' when large numbers of Muslims congregate in the mosques and visit the graveyards to offer ` Fateha ' for their departed ones . . . Stating that both the communities should exercise restraint , Maulana Rasheed said the government should do some introspection into some of its past actions . . .

NEW DELHI : The Delhi police on Wednesday visited the Lajpat Rai Market in the Walled City area and questioned several shopkeepers to find out whether the perpetrators of the Samjhauta Express blasts purchased circuit boards and electronic components used in the improvised explosive devices from there . The market is famous for its cheap electronic goods . . . While the Haryana police believe that two of the perpetrators got off the train when it slowed down about half-an-hour after it departed from the Old Delhi station , it is learnt that intelligence agencies here doubt the theory . ` Terrorists will not travel by the same train in which they have planted bombs unless they are suicide-bombers , ' said an officer . . . According to the officer , there was a possibility that the perpetrators , who could be more than four in number , left the suitcases containing the IEDs in the coaches on platform No. 18 and vanished from the scene before the train departed . Lucknow , May 23 : Vowing to come down heavily on disruptive elements in the wake of the LOC_Event serial bomb blasts , Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati today blamed the Samajwadi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party for hatching conspiracy to '' unsettle '' her government . . . '' SP and BJP being in a spot after losing the recent assembly elections in the state are resorting to spreading communal tension to destabilise my newly elected government , '' she told reporters . . . These parties had nothing in their hands and they were indulging in petty tactics to vent their frustration , she said , adding that they were feeling jittery as the Lok Sabha polls were nearing and SP and BJP had already lost ground . . . '' My government has taken the incident very seriously and would ensure that the guilty are booked and such incidents are not repeated during my regime , '' Ms Mayawati said . . . Meanwhile , the Principal Secretary ( Home ) K Chandramauli , the state Director General of Police ( DGP ) G P Sharma , Additional Director General ( ADG ) Shailja Kanat Mishra and ADG ( Law and Order ) Brijlal had been airdashed to Gorakhpur in a special plane to gauge the situation . . . The CM said she had asked these officers to submit their report to her at the earliest . . . . CHANDIGARH : Deadly RDX was used in the LOC_Event cinema hall blast in Ludhiana that left six dead and 30 wounded , Punjab Police said here on Friday . ` Traces of RDX have been found . The quantity of RDX and other explosives used in the blast is half-a-kg or less , ' ADGP -LRB- Law and Order -RRB- Chandershekhar told reporters . Forensic , NSG and Army experts had confirmed the use of the lethal explosive in the blast , he said . However , the intensity of the blast was ` not very high ' , he said quoting the team probing the case . The confirmation of the RDX had established involvement of cross-border anti-national forces in the incident , the ADGP said . He said police was zeroing in on the supects , adding investigations were in full swing and it was not desirable to give further details at this stage . A bomb blast in the cinema hall in Punjab 's industrial town on Sunday had killed six people and left 30 injured , mostly migrant labourers . A report from Ludhiana said investigators probing the blast had so far questioned 60 people , including former terrorists and their family members . Praveen Swami . . As forensic evidence trickles in , the list of possible suspects multiplies . . Terror groups have long history of collaboration with Pakistan-based Khalistani organisations . . BKI desperate to register success . . NEW DELHI : Even as the first fragments of forensic evidence of the LOC_Event Cinema bombing in Ludhiana have begun to trickle in , Punjab police investigators find themselves with a mounting list of suspects and , as yet , little hard evidence to work with . . . National Security Guard experts have determined that the bomb which ripped through the theatre was built around a core of Research Department Explosive , but officials said its final composition and construction would be known only after final results were available . . . Punjab police sources said they were focussing on the possible role of the Babbar Khalsa International -LRB- BKI -RRB- the last LOC_Event terror group believed to have credible offensive capabilities . Officials note that the globally-proscribed BKI , which frequently targeted migrant workers from Bihar during the past , has been desperate to register success . . . Ever since the Inter-Services Intelligence started to choke off funding to the BKI in 2005 , its Lahore-based chief Wadhawa Singh has been seeking to mount a major operation to raise funds from sympathisers in Europe and the United States of America , a New Delhi-based intelligence official told The Hindu . . . Only last month did the Punjab police seize 3.5 kg of RDX from a car owned by Jagraon resident Gurpreet Singh , son of a former terrorist . Investigators say Gurpreet Singh , who is absconding , met Wadhawa Singh earlier this year , after travelling to Lahore through Kuala Lumpur . . . Last year too , the Punjab police found evidence that the BKI was seeking to mount offensive operations . . . Four BKI terrorists , linked to a module controlled by the absconding Beant Singh assassin Jagtar Singh Tara , were arrested on March 21 , 2006 , and one kg of RDX was recovered . Just a day earlier , the Delhi police held the BKI operations chief Paramjit Singh Bheora and associates . Four kg of RDX was found in the terrorists safe-house near Karnal . . . BKI operative held . . In 2005 , the Delhi police arrested top BKI operative Jagtar Singh Hawara after his organisation bombed two movie theatres in New Delhi to protest what they claimed was its anti-Sikh politics . . . Hawara , architect of the 1995 assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh , escaped from Chandigarhs Burail Jail in 2004 . . . He was sentenced to death earlier this year . . . But intelligence officials also said the evidence available so far did not justify making a determination on which terror group most likely carried out Sundays strike . Islamist terror groups have hit targets in Punjab before a fact of significance given the spate of recent attacks nationwide . . .

The peaceful city witnessed a never-before kind of bloodshed on Tuesday evening . Eight blasts occurred in six places within one kilometre of the walled city , when people including foreign tourists were either shopping or returning home from their work . The first blast occurred at LOC_Event , the jewellery market in the heart of the city and within 50 yards from this place , another one took place near the LOC_Event at LOC_Event , one of the five gateways to the city . Hawa Mahal , the palace of winds , which recently got a new coat of pink , stood a mute witness to the blasts that took place one after the other . The third one took place in LOC_Event near the LOC_Event , barely 30 yards away from Hawa Mahal and the fourth took place just outside the LOC_Event police station near a shoe shop . Thus four blasts took place in close proximity of the LOC_Event , though they did not damage the structure . The fifth blast took place near LOC_Event , the tallest building towering over the city . It is located near Tripoliya Gate , which leads to the City Palace where the former ruler Brig Bhawani Singh resides . The Sargah Sooli is about 120 metres from Hawa Mahal . The sixth blast took place at the most crowded part of the city near the LOC_Event at LOC_Event . The Sargah Sooli , the 20-metre high tower was used as the watch tower by the rulers of Jaipur . The terrorists chose Tuesday as they know that a large number of devotees of Lord Hanuman come to offer prayers at the two temples dedicated to Him . These temples are located at the two gateways of the walled city because as per mythology , Lord Hanuman is considered the god of strength and valour that would save the city from the enemies . The city witnessed two communal riots in the past 15 years in which many people died , but now the toll of serial blasts is higher than the two communal riots put together . JAIPUR/UDAIPUR : Illegal Bangladeshi migrants in LOC_Event will be identified in 30 days and could be deported as they came under the scanner of the state government after the serial blasts while a hotelier claimed he saw one of the suspects in Udaipur two days before the attack .

Forty such Bangladeshi nationals have been rounded up so far and are being interrogated , he said . Eight of them were detained in Ajmer . All District Collectors and Superintendents of Police have been directed to complete within 30 days the process of identifying Bangladeshi migrants living with or without voter ID cards and/or ration cards and get them verified , Rathore said . The procedures for deporting the identified illegal nationals could then be started , he said . The process has begun everywhere in the state , he added . The State 's Principal Home Secretary discussed with his central counterpart on Friday the option of deporting illegally staying Bangladeshi nationals , he added . The owner of SamorBagh restaurant in Udaipur Kamal Joshi was interrogated by police after he claimed on Friday that a person bearing resemblance to one of the sketches of suspects released on Thursday night was seen along with a woman in his restaurant on Sunday evening . JAIPUR : Terror Tuesday was not the first time LOC_Event was targeted . In 1993 similar serial bomb blasts were averted when alert intelligence officials foiled a bid to set off explosions in the Walled City area by arresting four persons with bomb materials . The accused are currently at Ajmer jail . Sources said a team of the Jaipur police has already been dispatched to the jail and officials have questioned the accused who were arrested in September 1993 when they were trying to plant tiffin bombs in Chandpol area of the Walled City , the same place were two blasts last Tuesday left more than 16 dead . Officials in the Rajasthan police confirmed that sleuths are probing possibilities of a link between the foiled serial blasts of 1993 and the May 13 attacks that killed 63 and injured hundreds . They , however , were tight-lipped and refused to divulge details of the interrogations and whether this resulted in any fresh leads . The perpetrators of the foiled 1993 attack had come from Mumbai and Delhi and aroused suspicion that they had linkages with the Mumbai serial blasts of March 12 , 1993 . Both LOC_Event and LOC_Event had witnessed riots after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 . Though both cities had been targets for terrorists , Mumbai was the first to have been hit when serial bombs rocked the commercial capital on March 12 , 1993 killing more than 250 . A close surveillance on terror modules in Mumbai and LOC_Event had later helped in cracking the LOC_Event terror bid , planned within months of the LOC_Event attack .

NEW DELHI : LOC_Event was attacked - possibly by local elements - only a day after the Centre warned Karnataka that it was high on the terror hitlist along with six other states and decided to amend a law to allow the CISF to provide security to private information technology and other sensitive industries in the country.Though there had not been any specific intelligence input for Bangalore which is home to over 1,500 private companies including IT majors like Infosys and Wipro , the home ministry on Thursday held a detailed discussion over Karnataka 's preparedness to deal with general threat in view of its vulnerability as per intelligence reports.A new security plan for IT and other industries was announced by home minister Shivraj Patil here immediately after the LOC_Event serial blasts on Friday . ` We have decided to provide security to the private sector also - specifically the IT industry in Bangalore . IT sector has come up very well and we are ready to amend the law and provide security to them , ' Patil told reporters while condemning the blasts.He said the Centre was always ready to provide CISF personnel for the IT industry but the law only allowed public sector undertakings -LRB- PSUs -RRB- to have the benefit of this paramilitary force.Once the Centre amends the law pertaining to the charter of CISF , the paramilitary force will be able to provide security to other private sector units - particularly the sensitive ones - as well in other states.The modalities were discussed by home ministry officials in the meeting on Thursday when top cops of six other states - Andhra Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra , Punjab and Assam - and Union Territory Delhi held discussions over several other security related issues . ` The meeting , chaired by special secretary -LRB- internal security -RRB- M L Kumawat , also emphasised the need to have a coordinated and systematic approach towards terror incidents to ensure an understanding of the modus operandi of the elements involved and thereby reduce possibilities of such incidents in future , ' said a senior home ministry official.A security review meeting also took place on Friday in which home secretary Madhukar Gupta took stock of the situation in the wake of LOC_Event serial blasts . The home ministry later asked forensic experts of National Security Guard -LRB- NSG -RRB- to rush to Bangalore to examine the nature of explosives used in the blasts . The Centre also asked states to remain on high alert.Though officials remained tight-lipped , they hinted that the blasts appeared to be the handiwork of local elements who used locally available explosives -LRB- possibly gelatine sticks -RRB- to create ` panic ' among the public as well as security personnel . They believed that the motive could be to send a message of their potential ` to strike at will ' anywhere in the city which had last witnessed a terror attack in December , 2005 . Although the IT city had not been attacked after the 2005 incident , it had always been in the list of jehadis - both from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- and local Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- . Incidentally , Karnataka is one of the six states including UP , Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh and Kerala where SIMI has a major presence.Footprints of SIMI were traced in a number of blasts in the past when it provided logistics to both LeT and Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami -LRB- HuJI -RRB- . -LRB- vishwa.mohan@timesgroup.com -RRB- . HYDERABAD : Andhra Pradesh cops have managed to establish that there 's a clear link between terror elements operating in neighbouring Karnataka and those active in its soil . They are , however , yet to identify them.Based on evidence gathered from the twin blasts in Hyderabad last year and on the interrogation of arrested persons in Karnataka , the police believe that sleeper cells in the beighbouring state have close ties with elements from Andhra . ` The aim of these groups , whether Huji or LeT or Simi , is clear . Bangalore and Hyderabad are being chosen as targets to create panic in the US as the cities house biggest IT companies from the US , ' said an official.Raziuddin Nasir , a Hyderabad resident , and his aide Hafiz Khan Adnan from Bangalore , were arrested near Hubli in Karnataka in January this year as terror suspects . Raziuddin 's father Maulana Naseeruddin , also from Hyderabad , is currently lodged in the Sabarmati Jail in connection with the murder of former Gujarat home minister Hiren Pandiya . Recently , Raziuddin 's elder brother Muqamuddin had been arrested in Hyderabad for alleged terror links . ` All this proves that the terror elements in the two states are operating as one group , ' said another police official.According to sources , interrogation of suspects revealed that the October 2005 attack on the STF office in Hyderabad and the December attack in IISC , Bangalore was carried out by the same elements . Another clear link between the terror elements in Andhra and Karnataka is the explosive material used in the blasts . In Friday 's Bangalore blasts , an explosive with an ammonium nitrate base was used , while in the Gokul Chat and Lumbini Park explosions in Hyderabad last August , a similar ammonium nitrate base was used.The Andhra police are , however , yet to dismantle a single sleeper cell . ` So many suspects have been rounded up in the LOC_Event and twin blasts last year . So many teams have sent across Karnataka , Jaipur and other blast sites , but not a single arrest directly related to terrorists could be made . This is very frustrating for us , ' a senior official said.Based on preliminary reports , the police have found some facts with regard to Friday 's serial blasts in Bangalore . ` One that it was a low intensity one intended to create only panic and not to cause major casualties . And like the the LOC_Event and LOC_Event blasts , it took place on a Friday during or just after the prayers , ' said another official . Who carried out the blasts at LOC_Event and LOC_Event ? Investigating agencies say they were masterminded by two Karachi-based men -- Rasool Khan Parti and Mohammad Sufiya Ahmed Patangiya . . . The duo , who currently reside at Farahan Arcade Gulistan in Karachi , are originally residents of Hyderabad , Andhra Pradesh . Prior to fleeing to Karachi , the duo were involved in recruitment of youth for jihadi activities in Hyderabad and other parts of the country . They were both allegedly members of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami , but recruited youth mainly from the Students Islamic Movement of India . Both men are wanted by the Gujarat police in connection with the murder of former state minister Haren Pandya . . . An Intelligence Bureau officer investigating last week 's blasts told rediff.com the duo planned the attacks during a meeting in Kotli , Pakistan , in May . . . Investigators say Indian Mujahideen is SIMI , V2 .0 . . The investigating agencies have also got information on the manner in which the blasts were executed . They say the entire operation was carried out by Indians , unlike in past instances where Pakistanis or Bangladeshis were used . . . Both Parti and Patangiya handpicked Indian youth working in the United Arab Emirates for the operation . This indicates that the youth had been picked well in advance and sent off to the UAE on the pretext of jobs there . This could have been done to avoid coming under the scanner of the Indian police , the officials say . From the UAE they were flown into Dubai from where they were taken to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan occupied Kashmir . . . The youth were divided in two groups and then trained personally by Patri and Patangiya . They were taught how to prepare bombs and execute the attacks . They called it training in alternate explosions . They were specifically taught how to make bombs using ammonium nitrate and directed to pick up the material locally . The use of RDX was ruled out since it was a problem to smuggle it across the border . . . B Raman : ISI 's Indianisation of jihad . . After undergoing training for a month , the youth were flown back to Dubai and then taken to Bangladesh . They were directed to cross over into India through the porous border . Investigating agencies say they took this trouble to avoid the police and security agencies . . . Once in India , the two groups split up and undertook the operations in LOC_Event and LOC_Event separately , although they kept in regular touch . The date and time of the attacks was fixed by Parti . . . The police are now trying to ascertain how many members were in each team and also from where they picked up the ammonium nitrate and other material required to make the bombs . The police suspect that the two teams assembled the bombs separately in the cities they attacked . . . The Bengaluru police believe that the ammonium nitrate must have been brought into Karnataka from Kerala via Mysore . However , police says the terrorists dumped a part of the consignment about 50 kilometres from Bengaluru as they feared detection . However , they managed to smuggle in enough material to carry out the blasts . . . View : The truth is security in India is a joke . . IB sources say they are concerned by the growing number of Indian youth being lured into terror outfits . They say that intercepts from Pakistan indicate that there are many Indian youth outside Parti 's home in Karachi daily . . . Investigating agencies are also looking into the statements made by SIMI activist Riazuddin Nasir aka Mohammad Ghouse . After his arrest in Karnataka earlier this year had told the police that he had met Parti in Karachi . . . Thanks to these men , not all bombs explode .

MUMBAI : The intelligence community believes the serial blasts of LOC_Event and LOC_Event were executed by a network of Wahabi fundamentalists masquerading as Indian Mujahideen.This terror network started by organizing blasts at holy places of rival Barelvi Muslims like the LOC_Event of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer , Rajasthan . Over the past five years the Wahabis , who are heavily funded by religious puritans in Saudi Arabia , have been conducting a high-intensity propaganda war within the Muslim community against so-called un-Islamic practices.Thousands of publications have been brought out by them to convince Muslims to follow the path of ` true Islam ' . Members of several front organizations also visit homes to convince people to abandon ` non-Islamic rituals ' . Sources said predictably these activities have been vehemently opposed by the Barelvis who also brought out publications countering the Wahabi ideology , which is believed to provide a theological justification for terror . A Barelvi publication titled Gair Mokallidon ke Akeede quotes chapter and verse from Wahabi publications , which are against Islam . In Mumbai maulanas like Saeed Noori have been in the forefront of the campaign to counter Wahabism.The proverbial last straw was the blast at Ajmer sharif . It provoked widespread reaction among the Barelvis against Wahabi fanaticism , which had backed the Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- , police sources said . ` Fearing their isolation , the Wahabi elements are now trying to project themselves as people fighting against injustice to Muslims as a whole . The decision to organize serial blasts in LOC_Event , including four in Narendra Modis constituency , was clearly aimed at getting the sympathy of the Muslim masses , ' a senior intelligence official observed . ` There is a big vacuum in Muslim leadership and the Wahabis are planning to fill the gap with their violent deeds , he added . However , a majority of Muslims have condemned the blasts and they say that a ` big injustice ' is being done to the community by those sponsoring such terror strikes.National secretary of the Nationalist Congress Party and noted advocate Majeed Memon said : ` The blasts can have no place in Islam . But if the Indian Mujahideens have any grievance then it should appoint a committee to have a dialogue with the government . Meanwhile , the Intelligence Bureau is reported to be close on the heels of the mastermind behind the blasts in LOC_Event and Ahmedabad LOC_Event The bureau is convinced that Indian Mujahideen has been trained by the ISI , which was why the blasts could be executed with professional precision . It is feared that the next targets could be in Maharashtra where the police force is at its demoralised worst . . . The diamond city of Surat came under the terror radar with 18 bombs being recovered from residential areas even as the Gujarat police detained three men for questioning in connection with the serial blasts . All bombs had been defused . . . All the bombs were recovered from different parts of LOC_Event area , housing most of Surat 's diamond processing units , in a span of four hours , putting severe pressure on the city 's bomb disposal squad . . . Panic gripped the city as the explosive devices were found from residential localities and the diamond workshop areas which the terrorists apparently wanted to target . They were all defused by the bomb disposal squad . . . 'Till now , nine bombs have been found , ' Surat Police Commissioner R M S Brar said . . . Police said three bombs were deactivated in the Mini Diamond Market area , three in LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event localities and three under the Varacha-Kapodra flyover . The contents of the neutralised explosive devices have been sent for forensic analysis . In Matavadi , a bomb was found handing from a tree while in LOC_Event it was left in an abandoned bag . . . In both these cases , the devices were planted near police outposts . The three suspected - Abdul Qadir , Hasil Mohammad and Hussain Ibrahim -- were detained near Limbi on Rajkot-Ahmedabad highway in Surendranagar district while they were leaving LOC_Event soon after the blasts that took 49 lives and left over 145 injured . . . Their possible links with outlawed SIMI and ` Indian Mujahideen ' are being investigated , police said . Police said they were questioning SIMI activist Abdul Halim but declined to give any details on what he has revealed so far . Halim , who was arrested on Sunday , was remanded in police custody by a court . . . Qadir , Hasil Mohammad and Ibrahim have been handed over to the Crime Branch of Ahmedabad police , which is probing the blast cases . . . . . ` They were detained as they contradicted each other in their initial questioning by Surendranagar police . The city crime branch is exploring if they have any links with SIMI and Indian Mujahideen , ' a police officer said . He said the trio were allegedly found carrying British currency and a large quantity of cash which was hidden under their vehicle 's seat . . . . . The Ahmedabad police claimed that they got ` some leads ' in the serial blasts cases and were working on them . . . Maintaining that the probe was moving in the ` right direction ' , Health Minister and government spokesperson Jaynarayan Vyas said , ` We are not going to reveal name -LRB- of any terror group -RRB- at present as it will be affect the probe ' . . . . . In Mumbai , the police detained for questioning three Kashmiri youths who were staying in a lodge in a southern locality in the city . The antecedents of the youth , who had come looking for jobs , are being verified , Joint Commissioner of Police -LRB- Crime -RRB- Rakesh Maria said . . . . . . . . . . NEW DELHI : The deadly serial bomb blasts on consecutive days in LOC_Event and LOC_Event have shown that the terrorists are confident of striking at will . But what 's the message they are trying to send ? Strategic analysis expert B Raman says that the blasts seem to be directed against the BJP-ruled states . ` The next series of blasts could possibly be carried out in Madhya Pradesh . It is no coincidence that SIMI cadres were arrested in Indore and Ujjain recently , ' he says . Earlier blasts this year were carried out in LOC_Event and LOC_Event , both BJP-ruled states . Five minutes before Saturday 's blasts , a television channel received an email from a terror group claiming to be Indian Mujahideen . In the past one year , this group has owned responsibility for several other strikes . They seem to nurse a grudge against the country 's criminal justice system . ` The innocent Muslims arrested in the -LRB- LOC_Event -RRB- bomb blast case are being tried for years and years , ' it says . There is no reference to Kashmir in the email . According to Ajai Sahni , executive director , Institute for Conflict Management , the blasts do not reflect any dramatic augmentation in the strike capacity of the terrorists . ` We must not forget that the terrorists have only been able to hit at soft targets since the Parliament attack in 2001 . And every soft target can not be secured . ' However , he adds : ` If the LOC_Event and LOC_Event blasts are co-related , then it reflects a greater central coordination . ' Sahni is of the view that the material damage wrecked by terrorism is limited . ` But the psychological impact is much more . And this is what needs to be controlled , ' he says . He feels there is an urgent need to shore up the national security apparatus also points out the roadblocks in the way . ` India 's police to population ratio is one of the lowest in the world , barring the poorer African countries . There is a high deficit of personnel in intelligence gathering . The IB has barely 3,500 field officers . We need to address these shortcomings , ' Sahni says . Security expert Prakash Singh , however , feels that the successive blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad show the overconfidence of the terrorists . ` They have no fear of being detected , arrested or prosecuted , ' he says . Affirms PR Chari , research professor , Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies , ` The blasts were a demonstration of their capabilities and a terse reminder of the state 's helplessness . ' . The designated Metropolitan Court in an on-camera hearing on Friday remanded all the 26 serial blasts accused in police custody till October 31 in two different cases . . . Twenty-two accused that . . included Mufti Mohammad Abu Bashr , Sajid Mansuri and Safdar Nagori were sent to police custody in connection with the blast that had taken place near a temple in LOC_Event .

Earlier on Thursday , lawyers representing the accused had walked out of the courtroom , alleging the court had not let them complete their arguments . . . They had also filed a joint application , demanding that they be permitted to meet the accused in the absence of police . Metropolitan Magistrate G M Patel had rejected this application . . . The other four accused , including Mehandi Hasan and Atiz-Ur-Rehman , who were first arrested by the Rajasthan Police in connection with the LOC_Event serial blasts , have been taken into custody in connection with the case registered with the Maninagar police station . . . Four blasts , including the one at the L G Hospital had taken place in the Maninagar area of the city . . . The Ahmedabad City Detection of Crime Branch -LRB- DCB -RRB- , the investigating agency , has stated in its remand application that the custody of the accused in the Danilimda case was necessary to present them before eye-witnesses for identification . . . The police said that by way of an identification parade before eyewitnesses they were looking to pin down the persons who had planted the bombs at various places . . . The DCB has also stated that details of the bicycles used to plant bombs are yet to be found from the accused . An activist of the banned Students Islamic Movement of LOC_Event , who was wanted in the 2002 LOC_Event riots , was arrested on Sunday from LOC_Event after a combing operation for his alleged connection to the blasts there . . . The police arrested Abdul Halim from Dani Limda in the heart of LOC_Event Halim had gone into hiding after the riots and remained untraceable so far . . . ` There were reports that he was in hiding in Delhi and we had intimidated the Delhi police as well . After receiving some specific inputs about his whereabouts , the crime branch arrested him during a combing operation , ' LOC_Event Joint Commissioner of Police Ashish Bhatia told PTI over phone . . . Bhatia said Halim was arrested in connection with Saturday 's blasts in LOC_Event that claimed 45 lives . . . Halim was wanted by the cops for enticing disgruntled youths from the riot victims ' refugee camps in and around LOC_Event and taking them to Uttar Pradesh . . . ` From there an organised network was engaged in sending these youths across the border for training purpose and Halim was a part of this network . Currently he is being interrogated , ' said Bhatia . . Gujarat Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a pan-India network behind the serial blasts in LOC_Event and other cities in the country with the arrest of 10 people , including Mufti Abu Bashir -- described as the mastermind behind the explosions . . . Rediff.com broke this news first : Breakthrough in LOC_Event blasts case . . ` We have almost entirely solved the case . We have arrested 10 people who were involved in the July 26 blasts including the mastermind , Mufti Abu Bashir , ' Gujarat Director General of Police P C Pande said . . . He said most of the arrested persons were part of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India and Bashir , picked up in a joint operation by the Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat Police , had planned out the entire blasts . . . In India , we do n't catch terrorists . . The Indian Mujahideen , which had claimed responsibility for the LOC_Event blasts , was nothing but ` another form ' of the banned SIMI , he said.Though refusing to give details about other arrested persons , he , however , said that the investigations into the blasts were carried out in a number of states , which included UP , Madhya Pradesh , New Delhi and Karnataka . . . ` In no previous blasts , has the case being completely solved . These arrests may give leads to other blasts that including Jaipur , Hyderabad and Uttar Pradesh , ' the police chief claimed . . . The one billion + cannon-fodder . . Throwing fresh leads to the LOC_Event blasts , Pande claimed that Bashir had stayed in that city for two years prior to the August 2007 blasts . . . About SIMI 's involvement with Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Tayiba , Pande said there had been some leads establishing the same . . . ` One may find links between SIMI-LeT and Pakistan 's ISI as the investigation proceeds , ' he said . . . ISI 's Indianisation of jihad . . The police was also on a look out for Mumbai-based Wipro engineer , alleged to be the co-conspirator in the blasts and his role in sending the email minutes before the blasts was not ruled out . . . Commenting about the Indian Mujahideen , Pande told reporters that it was nothing but an off-shoot created by the hardliners in the SIMI . . . Police said the SIMI cadres were given arms training in the jungles of Kerala in 2006 , which was followed by another round of training at Halol in central Gujarat in January this year . . . ` Terrorism and riots are not interlinked ' . . The arrested militants had made several plans to kidnap or hijack to free Safdar Nagori , an alleged top SIMI activist , arrested in Madhya Pradesh in March this year . . . Later it was decided to carry out a revenge attack as they failed to secure his release legally or through any other nefarious plan . ` Arrest of a mastermind in the city 's serial blasts case is a very important event and we believe that it will uncover many unsolved links to bomb blasts that took place in other parts of the country , ' Pande said . . . The plan for the bomb blasts in LOC_Event was worked out at a training camp held by SIMI leader Safdar Nagori in Halol taluka of Vadodara in January 2008 , Joint Police Commissioner -LRB- Ahmedabad crime branch -RRB- Ashish Bhatia said . . . Investigators say Indian Mujahideen is SIMI , V2 .0 . . Nagori was arrested by Madhya Pradesh police in March 2008 . . . According to Bhatia , a series of meetings were held to plan the bomb blasts in the city in the month of April , May and June , while the final meeting was held on July 20 , in the city . . . Abu Bashir and other suspects arrested by the police were present in all these meetings where they designed the strategy for execution of their masterplan , Bhatia said , who is also heading the investigations into the serial blasts . . . During the meetings , the suspects had planned details of how , when and where the blasts will occur and also assigned specific duties to each person , he added . . . ` The blasts are a proclamation by terrorists ' . . ` Their strategy was to place small explosives in different places to create panic among people . And then have a powerful explosion at a hospital , where all those injured in the small explosions would be rushing to . So they targeted the city civil hospital , ' Bhatia said . . . The details of the planning were divulged by nine persons arrested by the police , including four from Vadodara and five from Ahmedabad , he added.The nine persons arrested are - Jahid Sheikh , Yunus Mansuri , Shamsuddin Sheikh , Arif Kadri , Gyasuddin , Imran , Usman Agarbattiwala , Iqbal Sheikh and Sajid Mansuri -- all in the age group of 20-25 , police said . . .

AHMEDABAD : The car bomb that killed 29 people in the Civil Hospital blast on Saturday travelled back and forth between Ahmedabad and Vadodara at least six times between July 3 and 26 , investigations have revealed.Of the four car bombs used by terrorists in Gujarat two that exploded in Ahmedabad on Saturday and the other two found abandoned in Surat police has been able to gather some information on the movement of only the WagonR that caused the maximum damage at the hospital.This car was stolen from Navi Mumbai on July 3 but the complaint was filed later . Terrorists used this vehicle extensively for travel between Ahmedabad and Vadodara , as per expressway records . It is possible that the bombers used Vadodara as the base for making bombs and also travelled to Surat in the vehicle during the period.The car used in the Civil Hospital blast had a fake registration number GJ 6D 9778 of a Vadodara two-wheeler . Inquiries revealed that the first record of the car 's movement was at the Vadodara toll plaza at 3 pm on July 3 , indicating that it was headed for Ahmedabad.Subsequently , movements of the car are recorded on July 7 , 8 , 9 , 23 and 24 . Police believe the bombs may have been brought to Ahmedabad just two days before the blasts.On July 26 , the car packed with IEDs and LPG gas cylinders became the spearhead of the terrorist operation , accounting for nearly two-third of the total casualties in Ahmedabad.Movement of the car bomb along ExpresswayJuly 3 LOC_Event to Ahmedabad July 7 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 8 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 9 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 23 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 24 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-Ahmedabad . AHMEDABAD/MUMBAI : Navi Mumbai , generally dismissed as the bedroom suburb of Mumbai , has suddenly become the focus of anti-terror operations . After the India Mujahideen threat email was traced to Sanpada in Navi Mumbai , it now transpires that all the four cars converted into bombs-on-wheels were stolen from Mumbai 's twin city.The cars , all of them of Maruti make , are believed to have travelled from Navi Mumbai to LOC_Event with a stopover in Vadodara , where they were loaded with explosives . Two of these cars blew up in public hospitals in LOC_Event on Saturday.Three WagonRs and one Maruti 800 , stolen from Navi Mumbai on July 7 and July 15 , made their way to LOC_Event through Surat and Vadodara , where the deadly incendiary material for the bombs was loaded . Investigations by the Ahmedabad crime branch reveal that their passage on fake Vadodara registration numbers were recorded at toll booths in Maharashtra and on the Ahmedabad-Vadodara expressway.LPG cylinders packed in cars for maximum damageSources in LOC_Event said that while one WagonR and a Maruti 800 headed for LOC_Event , two WagonRs probably returned to Surat these are the ones which were found in Puna Gaam and Varachha areas of Surat on Sunday , fully loaded with explosive material including ammonium nitrate , ball bearings and timers . In LOC_Event , sleuths who attempted a reconstruction of the car bomb in the civil hospital , suspect that the car which blew up at 8pm was brought in one hour before it exploded.The reconstruction on Monday also indicated that the boot of this WagonR had a CNG tank . The free space in the boot was packed with ammonium nitrate in between three 5kg LPG cylinders . The second blast at this hospital , which happened after a short interval , was probably the explosion of an LPG gas cylinder , said a senior police officer.From the way the car has been damaged , it is also believed that the LPG cylinders were placed on their sides , horizontally , beside the bomb . All the gas cylinders were uncorked and kept slightly leaking.The Maruti 800 that exploded at LG Hospital , another site where the injured were streaming in on Saturday , did not claim any human lives as it lacked intensity having only one LPG bottle packed in its small boot . Police sources in Mumbai say there are several inter-state car theft syndicates that steal vehicles based on orders given by ` clients ' . The Mumbai crime branch had recently busted an inter-state racket where they had even arrested seven persons , including DMK corporator Palaniswami alias Ramaswami -LRB- 49 -RRB- from Salem in TN . At least29 people were killed and over 100were injured as 16 serial bomb blasts rocked LOC_Event on Saturday evening . Cycles were probably used to plant the bombs while some were placed on buses , G K Parmar , joint commissioner of LOC_Event police , told rediff.com . . . Parmar said thatthe police are on the lookout for more live bombs . The explosions occurred at LOC_Event , LOC_Event circle , LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event bridge , LOC_Event and LOC_Event and created a wave of panic . . . Crowded areas including market places were hit in the synchronised ` low-intensity ' explosions in a space of 60 to 70 minutes after the first blast hit LOC_Event at 6.45 pm . The bombs placed in tiffin boxes were strapped on to bicycles . Some of the blast sites were in sensitive areas in the old city but the situation was peaceful as the night wore on . . . There were three blasts in LOC_Event -- the constituency of Chief Minister Narendra Modi -- and two in LOC_Event targeting a state transport CNG bus and near the old LOC_Event . . . ` As per the latest information , 29 persons were killed , ' Modi told reporters late on Saturday night . . . Significantly , two blasts occurred in the premises of Civil and LG hospitals where several victims of the explosions in other areas were being rushed exacerbating the already tense situation . A nationwide alert has been sounded . . . A shocked Modi said the LOC_Event blasts was a ` war against LOC_Event ' and a handiwork of terror groups . Declaring there should be one voice against terrorism , Modi also said there is a ` mastermind group and a mastermind country ' behind the blasts . The people behind the attack will be ` hounded out ' , said Modi , who also spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . . . ` The blasts were of low intensity and similar to those which hit Bangalore , ' Union Minister of State for Home Sriprakash Jaiswal told reporters in Kanpur . . . A common feature seen at the blast sites was use of blue ballbearings in the explosions . . . The civic authorities have stopped plying of all the city transport buses . . . LOC_Event has been put on high alert following the blast . Security has been beefed up across the state , particularly in Gandhinagar , and special police teams were deployed at vulnerable places , said LOC_Event Home Minister Amit Shah . . . He said the government would take all measures to maintain law and order . . . Sources said that minutes before the blasts , the Intelligence Bureau received a mail from the Indian Mujahideen , which stated , ` Stop us if you can . ' . . A couple of bombs were reported to have been placed in tiffin boxes in a modus operandi similar to the explosions outside a Lucknow court last year . . . A high level meeting of state director general of police and home secretaries will be convened shortly , said Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta . . . The LOC_Event serial blasts come a day after two people were killed innine serial blasts that shook Bengaluru . . . Bapunagar , Isranpur and Raipur , where the blasts have taken place , are considered to be communally sensitive areas . . . President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm . . . Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil has convened a high-level meeting to review the security situation in the country . . . ' I do not wish to say anything other than this that a meeting will be held tomorrow at 11 am to review the security situation in the country , ' Patil told reporters . . .

It is worrisome that a bomb blast in any corner of the world spells trouble for Muslims .

The terrorist attack on LOC_Event in Gujarat state was among the worst of its kind . Bombs carefully planted in public spaces to cause maximum casualties exploded in quick succession . . . One day before the blasts , seven small bombs had exploded in LOC_Event , the centre of India 's thriving software industry . The security forces fear that more cities may soon be targeted . . . `` The entire nation has been asked to step up security at vital installations , '' said an offical spokesman . . . All the bombs in LOC_Event exploded within the space of an hour . They detonated in the midst of teeming bazaars , congested neighbourhoods and outside hospitals , which were tending the injured from the first blasts . . . While the death toll rose to 45 , at least 160 people were wounded in the relatively affluent , Muslim-dominated city , including many women and children . . . India hit by blasts . . India on high alert as bombers sought . . The bombs , fashioned from ammonium nitrate and packed with ball bearings to maximise their destructive power , were strapped to bicycles and motorbikes . Some were hidden under the seats of crowded public buses - and all were detonated with timers at carefully staggered intervals . . . Two doctors were killed by explosions in two adjoining hospitals . . . `` Never before have we seen such ruthless bombings of hospitals . The terrorists ' objective was to strike the defenceless and deepen the fear , '' said a senior security official . . . Pankaj Patel said that his son , Rohan , and daughter , Pratha , were killed at Ahmedabad hospital . . . `` I came with my two children to cheer up my mother [ in ) hospital . They were laughing when the blast occurred . Now they are dead , '' he said . . . O. P. Mathur , the city 's police commissioner , said another unexploded device had been found . Around 30 people had been detained for questioning , he added . . . `` Anti-national elements have been trying to create panic among the people of our country . The LOC_Event blasts are part of the same strategy , '' said Shivraj Patil , the home affairs minister . . . The aim was to trigger communal bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims in the volatile city , he added . . . Six years ago , Ahmedabad and the surrounding state of Gujarat endured a month-long pogrom , targeted mainly at Muslims , during which at least 2,500 people were murdered . . . A little-known group styling itself the `` Indian Mujahideen '' claimed responsibility for the bombings in an email sent to local television channels minutes before the first explosion at around 6.30 pm yesterday . This message declared that the attack was retribution for the killings of Muslims in 2002 . . . Narendra Modi , Gujarat 's chief minister from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , is one of India 's most controversial politicians . He stands accused of organising anti-Muslim riots six years ago and inciting murders . The United States has placed him on a banned list and refused to issue him with a visa . . . Indian Mujahideen has also claimed responsibility for last November 's bombings in the city of Jaipur , which killed 63 people . . . In a similar message sent moments before the attack , the group said the blasts were retaliation for India 's alliance with America and Britain . . . But Indian and Western security officials believe the `` Indian Mujahideen '' is merely a new name for Islamist extremist groups , based in neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan , which have carried out frequent attacks in India 's cities . . . Their central grievance is India 's control over a large area of the disputed territory of Kashmir , which has a Muslim majority . They also object to the country 's strategic and defence co-operation with the West , especially America . . . `` The command and control for all recent serial bombings and terrorist strikes remain the same and appear to be based in India 's neighbourhood , '' said Arun Sahgal , a retired Brigadier and security analyst with the United Service Institute said . . . Sources in India 's Federal Intelligence Bureau the attacks demonstrated the ability of foreign insurgent groups to strike `` anywhere '' by using disaffected Muslims as `` carriers '' .

Headed by the Principal Secretary , Home , the committee will coordinate inputs with other States which had faced similar terror attacks . . . The committee would also study the materials available with the Centre and its intelligence agencies about terrorist activities in different parts of the country to assist the CID -LRB- Crime -RRB- investigating Saturdays serial blasts in LOC_Event . . . The police believe that the diamond and art silk city of LOC_Event , the second major commercial centre in the State after LOC_Event , may have escaped the jaws of death and destruction as two abandoned cars one with live explosives and another with ammunition were seized in different parts of the city on Sunday . Closure of cinemas and shopping malls in the heavily populated city was ordered after the police defused a huge bomb found in an abandoned bag near a hospital on the City Light Road and recovered the cars abandoned at Punamgaon and Randel , Varacha Road localities . . . Police said gelatin sticks , timers , ammonium nitrate powder , tiffin boxes and other materials were found in one abandoned car which the locals said was lying there for couple of days . The materials were enough to manufacture about eight to 10 powerful crude bombs , the kind of devices believed to had been used in the serial blasts . . . Responding to an appeal from the police , the people in LOC_Event by and large stayed indoors despite it being a Sunday . This was to avoid large gatherings that could be easy targets for terrorists . . . In view of the high alert , night shows in all the cinemas in Rajkot , Bhavnagar and several other cities and towns were suspended for Sunday . . . Early in the morning , two live bombs were recovered from a garbage can near a LOC_Event in LOC_Event locality in Maninagar in Ahmedabad , where the first of the 17 blasts occurred on Saturday evening . . . The special bomb squad was summoned and the bombs defused . . . The police said the timers of the bombs had not been set properly . The bombs could have caused extensive damage .

The death toll from yesterday 's wave of bombings in the Indian city of LOC_Event has risen to 45 , a government official said today . . . Jaynarayan Vyas said 161 people were injured when 16 separate small bombs went off in several parts of the city , which has a history of violent clashes between the Hindu majority and Muslim minority . He also said that 30 people had been arrested in connection with the explosions , which came a day after seven synchronised explosions rocked the southern city of LOC_Event , the hub of India 's burgeoning information technology industry , killing two and wounding five others . . . Yesterday 's attacks in LOC_Event happened in two waves early in the evening local time . Some of the devices were hidden in lunchboxes or bicycles . The first series exploded near busy LOC_Event places . The second , about 20 minutes later , went off in and around a hospital where casualties were being taken . At least six people died there . . . ` We saw a blue bag near the trauma centre , and before we could react we saw it explode in a shine of blinding light , and some 40 people were hit by flying shrapnel , ' said Vipul Patil , a doctor at the Dhanwantari hospital . . . The side of a bus was blown off and its windows shattered while another vehicle was engulfed in flames . . . Prithviraj Chavan , a junior in the prime minister 's office , called yesterday 's bombings `` deplorable '' and said they were set off by people `` bent upon creating a communal divide in the country '' . That is the sort of language officials tend to use when blaming Islamic militants suspected of being behind a series of coordinated bomb attacks across the country in recent years . Targets have included mosques , Hindu temples and trains . . . ` Anti-national elements have been trying to create panic among the people of our country . [ The ) blasts in LOC_Event seem to be part of the same strategy , ' the federal home minister , Shivraj Patil , said . . . Several television stations said they had received an email claiming responsibility from a group called the Indian Mujahideen at the time of yesterday 's blasts . The same group said it was behind bombs in Jaipur , western India , in May that killed more than 60 people . The email made no mention of Friday 's bombings in LOC_Event , according to reports . . . Narendra Modi , the chief minister of Gujarat state , which includes LOC_Event , condemned the blasts as `` a crime against humanity '' and said the group or groups behind them were `` using a similar modus operandi all over the country '' . The state government home Minister Amit Shah said : `` The government had received a threat email , and we are probing it . '' . . Tension between Hindus and Muslims is acute in Gujarat , a relatively wealthy state . It was the scene of riots in 2002 that left about 2,500 people dead . They were triggered by a fire on a train packed with Hindu pilgrims that killed 60 passengers . The cause was never proven , but Hindu extremists blamed the deaths on Muslims and reacted by rampaging through Muslim areas . . . . None . Praveen Swami . . New Indian Mujahideen e-mail warns of more attacks ; claims suspects are innocent . . Qureshi left Ahmedabad on . . July 24 . . Saturdays e-mail bears the signature of al-Arbi . . NEW DELHI : Top Indian Mujahideen operative Abdul Subhan Qureshi , who investigators believe was the principal architect of the July serial bombings in Gujarat , could be hiding in Mumbai , according to the Maharashtra police . . . Police sources said their belief rested on the fact that an e-mail issued on Saturday , insisting that suspects held for their alleged role in the bombings are innocent and threatening further attacks , has been traced to a computer in Mumbais Matunga area . . . Investigators have determined that Qureshi , who investigators say wrote the e-mail claiming responsibility for the bombings on behalf of the Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- and Lashkar-e-Taiba-linked Indian Mujahideen , left for Mumbai on a night train from Ahmedabad on July 24 , two days before the bombings . . . Qureshi is thought to have e-mailed the Indian Mujahideen minutes before the bombing using a private homes unsecured wi-fi network in Navi Mumbai . . . The Gujarat police said Qureshi , a crack bomb-maker , who is believed to have held several training camps for SIMI operatives from 2006 to 2008 , spent at least eight weeks in a flat in Ahmedabads Vatva neighbourhood , supervising the making of the explosive devices used in Gujarat . Qureshi , the Gujarat police claims to have been told by arrested suspects , also organised for contacts in Mumbai to provide four stolen cars used in the bombings . . . Photographs of at least two of the stolen cars are contained in the e-mail , to establish its authenticity . . . Qureshi graduated from the Bharatiya Vidyapeeth in suburban Mumbais Kharghar area in 1990 , and later did a computer course from a private institute . . . For some time , he worked as a salesperson for a company that marketed Wipro computer products in Mumbais western suburbs . . . He was recruited by SIMI in 1998 , shortly before the critical Aurangabad convention where jihadists in its ranks first developed an organisational relationship with the Lashkar-e-Taiba . . . Soon after , Qureshi left his job to become a full-time Rukun , or organisational cadre . . . He became close to a core circle of operatives who were to execute a series of major terrorist attacks , starting with the Gateway of India bombings in 2003 . . . Qureshis associates in SIMI include Rahil Abdul Rehman Sheikh , who is wanted for his central role in organising the 2006 serial bombings in Mumbai , and Ehtesham Siddiqi , the former SIMI Maharashtra general-secretary , who is now being tried for his alleged role in the attacks . . . e-mail claims . . In the e-mail , the Indian Mujahideen on its full authority declares that by the Grace of Allah not even a single mujahid from our ranks , who played even a minute role in the blasts , has been arrested to date . We are completely safe and in Allah , The Most Sublime , do the believers put their trust . Whatever -LSB- Gujarat police officers -RSB- Ashish Bhatia and P.C. Pandey have bragged about -LSB- key suspects -RSB- Mufti Abul Bashir , Sajid Mansuri , Zahid Shaikh and other innocent brothers like them is a big lie . . . However , the Indian Mujahideen addresses the escaped multitude of faithless disbelievers , thanking our Lord for humiliating you by our hands at Ahmedabad and Surat and calming our hearts by chastising your bodies with a disgraceful punishment . . . It states : we declare that with the will of Allah -LSB- that -RSB- our attacks on you will be severely intensified from now on and with our extremely lethal strikes , which are to follow successively , we shall make you weep and repent for the evil hatred and grudge against Islam and Muslims . . . In the e-mail , the Indian Mujahideen seems to suggest that a set of malfunctioning improvised explosive devices found in Surat were designed not to detonate . You are nothing but victims of our terrorizing plan that turns you helpless when the Wrath of Allah descends on you . Just think O numbskulls ! How many microchips can be faulty ? One ? Or two ? Or all thirty at the same time ? This is yet another threat to those filthy Hindus of Surat , who have failed to take heed , and a reminder to Narendra Modi that it is not over . . . Saturdays e-mail bears the signature of an individual , who identities himself by the pseudonym al-Arbi . Al-Arbis signature also figured on the Indian Mujahideen e-mail issued minutes after the Gujarat bombings , along with that of another operative who uses the pseudonym Guru al-Hindi . . . Guru al-Hindi was the sole signatory on Indian Mujahideen messages that were issued after the terror attacks in Jaipur and on three trial court buildings in Uttar Pradesh .

The Indian Mujahideen email , titled ` the Message of Death ' , said : ` In the name of Allah , Indian Mujahideen strikes back once more . ... Do whatever you can . Stop us if you can . ' This group had sent emails before the UP court blasts , the Jaipur and Ahmedabad blasts . This time , too , it sent an email to media groups , however , 10 minutes after the first blast . And for the third time , it specifically threatened The Times of India for attacking terror.The first blast took place at LOC_Event at 6.10 pm . Soon after that , two explosions rocked LOC_Event , one at LOC_Event near LOC_Event at 6.30 pm and the other near the Metro station at the LOC_Event at 6.31 pm . Almost simultaneously , a blast hit M-block market in Greater Kailash-I near McDonald 's and seven minutes later another bomb went off near LOC_Event in the same market.All blasts were of low intensity , and the defused bombs suggest they used the cocktail of ammonium nitrate , gun powder , ball bearings and nails , with timer devices , the same kind of bombs that were used in Jaipur , Bangalore and Ahmedabad , indicating that it 's the same group that 's wreaking terror across the country.Eyewitnesses said that explosives at LOC_Event were kept in a dustbin in LOC_Event of LOC_Event while at LOC_Event , the bombs were kept in a dustbin next to the bus stand .

The impact of the blasts in LOC_Event could be gauged by the fact that an auto was thrown up in the air and got caught in the electrical wires . ` The terrorist have used the CNG autorickshaw to maximise the impact and we have so far not been able to find the number plate of the vehicle , ' said a police officer.Eyewitnesses claim that explosives were loaded on a bicycle near LOC_Event in LOC_Event I and another inside a dustbin near McDonald 's . All the blasts were of low intensity and ball bearings were used to maximize the impact , said investigators .

LOC_Event : Preliminary investigations into the Delhi blasts on Saturday point to the hand of an Indian Mujahideen-SIMI cell led by Abdul Subhan , the techie jehadi from Mumbai and Qayamuddin . -LRB- Watch -RRB- The modus operandi emails from Indian Mujahideen warning of or coinciding with blasts , use of ammonium nitrate and ball bearings pellets and other sharpnels in explosives , use of crowded markets so that higher casualties can be achieved even by low-intensity blasts carries the signature of IM-SIMI . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Besides , the email from Indian Mujahideen , like the two previous ones , was sent from Mumbai , Subhan 's base using an unsecured wi-fi connection of Ms Kamran Power Private Limited in Chembur , owned by one Mr Kamat . Although the mail came from Mumbai , references to newspaper coverage in Delhi editions in the past few weeks , suggests that the draftsman may have been in Delhi.The police has been able to recover the chasis number of the autorickshaw that was used for the blast in Ghaffar Market in Karol Bagh . Accroding to latest reports , eight people have been detained and are being questioned . ` We have some good clues , ' said a police spokesman.Although Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi stated in Bangalore that he had earlier this month told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Advisor that there were plans to strike the Capital , intelligence sources were taken aback by the Indian Mujahideen 's choice of Delhi . They were suspecting Subhan and Qayamuddin , computer-graphic designer from Vadodara to strike in either Maharashtra or MP.The probe is going to focus on the likely contacts of Subhan , Qayamuddin , and other absconding IM-SIMI activists Abdul Bashar , Razeek , Afridi -LRB- all from Gujarat -RRB- , Ikram , Inam and Musa -LRB- all from Madhya Pradesh -RRB- . Abdul Subhan who has evaded arrest after narrowly escaping a raid by Gujarat Police in Surat on SIMI hideout , has made no secret of his anger over the Ahmedabad crackdown . In the last email that he wrote , intelligence sources suggest , for Indian Mujahideen using the nom de guerre of Al arbi , Abdul Subhan tried to mislead the investigators by calling all the arrested innocent and Kenneth Haywood , the US national whose wi-fi he is suspected to have used to send the email warning of Ahmedabad blasts , an ally.The return of Haywood has exposed the ploy -LRB- significantly , the email on Saturday was conspicuously silent on this -RRB- . But Abdul Subhan who is regarded as an ace bomb maker also came off as someone smarting under the humiliation of the botched attack on Surat none of the bombs planted in the diamond city went off because of faulty integrated circuits used in the timers . His last mail had shown his anxiety to prove his credentials . Saturday 's bomb blast in LOC_Event flower market has once again brought the legend of Abdul Karim Tunda back to life . The initial clues about the make of the bomb give it a striking resemblance to the bombs Tunda specialised in . . . What strengthens the idea further is that Abdul Halim Shamsullah Khan Pathan -LRB- 43 -RRB- who was arrested by Ahmedabad police soon after the LOC_Event blasts had confessed to his links with Tunda . . . Pathan was accused of recruiting disgruntled riot-affected youth of Gujarat and sending them for terror training abroad . . . An expert in manufacturing bombs , Tunda is wanted in 33 cases under the Explosives Substances Act in Delhi and other states . His standard bomb cocktail consists of potassium chlorate mixed with sugar kept in a tight container packed with nails . In this container , amid the potassium chlorate mix , he packs in tiny bottles of homoeopathic medicines , filled with sulphuric acid . As soon as the container is tilted , the acid begins to seep out into the chlorate-sugar mixture . The package begins to emanate smoke and the blast follows . . . This is exactly what happened during Saturday 's blast . `` Eyewitnesses said smoke emanated from the polythene before it blew up , '' said a senior police officer . `` Also the fact that Pathan was found to be closely involved can not really be ignored , '' he added . . . Also , according to NSG officials , the bomb was crude and made of chemicals . The Joint Commissioner of the Special Cell , Karnal Singh , however said it was too early to comment . . . Abdul Karim got the nickname Tunda , after he lost an arm when one of his own bombs burst in his hand . . . Born to a lower middle class family in Delhi , he moved to Pilkhuwa near Ghaziabad . . . He briefly ran a homeopathic medicine store . After the business failed , he moved to Mumbai 's Mominpura and set up fabric dyeing business . . . ... contd . Devesh K. Pandey . . 24 injured ; police believe it is not linked to the recent serial blasts . . LOC_Event : Exactly a fortnight after a series of five blasts rocked the Capital , a bomb exploded in the crowded LOC_Event area of LOC_Event on Saturday , claiming the lives of a nine-year-old boy and a 60-year-old unidentified man . Nearly two dozen people were injured . . . The police believe that the blast is not linked to the September 13 explosions . However , a red alert has been sounded in the LOC_Event . . . According to eyewitnesses , two men riding a black motorcycle dropped a polythene bag containing the bomb near an electrical goods shop at the LOC_Event around 2-15 p.m. Nine-year-old Santosh , who was standing nearby , thought the duo had accidentally dropped the bag and picked it up to return it to the riders when the bomb exploded . . . The impact of the blast was such that Santoshs head was blown off and he was tossed into the air . . . Tilak Raj , who was in the market , said : Soon after the blast , the lane was filled with thick smoke . When it cleared , I saw people lying on the road in blood-splattered clothes writhing in pain . A boy was lying motionless . . . Baldev Khattar , who was at the entrance of his electronic goods shop , was injured , but his nephew , Vikas , escaped unhurt as he was inside . Several other shopkeepers and passers-by were injured . Three of the four shops damaged in the blast belong to the Khattar family , said Jitender , who works in a utensils shop . . . Residents and shopkeepers immediately called up the police and rushed the injured to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences , Safdarjung Hospital and Fortis Hospital . . . The police soon reached the spot and cordoned off the blast site . . . By then all shopkeepers in the area had downed the shutters and the market was closed . . . Preliminary investigations indicated that the bomb was of a crude nature , very similar to the ones used in the Capital during 1997-98 by a module headed by top Lashkar-e-Taiba militant Abdul Karim Tunda , who is now said to be in Pakistan . While the bomb had a chemical-detonation mechanism , nails were used as splinters . . . Joint Commissioner of Police -LRB- Southern Range -RRB- Ajay Kashyap said the bomb was planted by two motorcycle-borne men who were in their early 30s . . . They were dressed in black jeans and shirts and were wearing helmets . The motorcycle bore a LOC_Event registration number . . . RELATED LINKS . Staff Reporter . .

Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh has already announced ex gratia for the victims family members and extend financial help to the injured . Even as the number of persons killed in Tuesday night 's powerful explosion in LOC_Event rose to 17 , the Kangleipak Communist Party -LRB- Military Council -RRB- KCP -LRB- MC -RRB- on Wednesday claimed responsibility for the blast and said it did so as part of its campaign against gambling that reaches its peak during Diwali . . . A press note distributed to newspaper offices in LOC_Event on Wednesday evening said the KCP -LRB- MC -RRB- triggered the explosion in order to put an end to lagao , a form of gambling which it said was an `` alien culture '' and was adversely affecting Manipuri society . . . `` Lagao is a form of gambling which is alien to Meitei culture and it needs to be stopped , '' said the statement signed by Lanheiba Meitei , leader of the KCP -LRB- MC -RRB- , one of the several factions of the original KCP that was formed in 1980 .

Sources said at least 20 persons are undergoing treatment in the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences while some are in the JN Hospital too . The LOC_Event attacks drew widespread international condemnation as cowardly acts of terrorism . But beneath the stock responses was an undercurrent of anxiety that the atrocity could aggravate latent tensions between India and Pakistan . . . George Bush offered his condolences to the Indian people as the White House convened a meeting of top intelligence and counter-terrorism officials . President-elect Barack Obama was briefed by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and said in a statement : `` These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism . The US must continue to strengthen partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks . '' . .

'' . . The Pope and the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon both deplored the violence . . . Gordon Brown said : `` I think I speak for the whole world - shocked and outraged at the tragic destruction of innocent lives . I have already sent my sympathy and support to prime minister [ Manhoman ) Singh . We will do everything we can to help the Indian government . '' . . David Miliband , the foreign secretary , condemned `` a callous inhuman and indiscriminate attack on people of all races and all religions '' . He said : `` This is an attack on all of us because democracy in India is vibrant and because Mumbai is one of the world 's most diverse cities . '' . . Comments by prime minister Singh blaming the attacks on a terrorist group with `` external linkages '' rang alarm bells that echoed the dark days of India-Pakistan relations when India routinely saw a Pakistan hand in militant attacks , blaming groups it claimed were set up by Pakistan 's spy agency , the Inter-Services Intelligence , or ISI , to avenge Pakistan 's defeat by India in the 1971 war . . . A terrorist attack on India 's parliament in December 2001 triggered a mass mobilisation along the two countries ' borders and brought them close to a fourth war . That incident was blamed by India on Pakistan-based Kashmiri militant groups . . . Pakistan 's government strongly condemned the violence and expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life . Pakistan 's foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who arrived in India on Wednesday , condemned the attacks but warned against jumping to any conclusions about the background to them . . . Miliband paid tribute to Singh , saying : `` I believe that the comments and leadership of prime minister Singh show that he is a man also of great statesmanship and great determination to build links between India and Pakistan . '' . . . LOC_Event : The death toll at LOC_Event -LRB- LOC_Event -RRB- in the recentterror attack should serve to be a lesson to a section of politicians trying to communalise the issue of terrorism . The two gunmen , who spread terror at LOC_Event last Wednesday , killed a total of 58 people at CST , 22 of them being Muslims.One Muslim family that took a body blow in the carnage was the Ansaris from Tulsiwadi in Tardeo . Four members of the family -- Abbas Ansari -LRB- 40 -RRB- , Rakhila Ansari -LRB- 40 -RRB- , Mohammad Ansari -LRB- 40 -RRB- and Sarfaraz Ansari -LRB- 17 -RRB- -- were killed in the firing.CR officials said the Muslims killed included both LOC_Event residents as well as outsiders who might have come here for work or to meet relatives . Many of them were waiting for trains headed for Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal , said officials.A significant percentage of the 95 people seriously injured in the firing were also Muslims . Eighteen of these 95 , who have been given ex-gratia for treatment , are Muslims . ` The bullet does not care for the victim 's religion , '' a CR security official said.The list of victims prepared by Central Railway -LRB- CR -RRB- also shows the dead to include four foriegners and eight bodies are yet to be identified . CR officials said they were not able to ascertain the permanent addresses of three foreigners , Michael Moss -LRB- 73 -RRB- , Jurman Rudolf -LRB- 68 -RRB- and Schmader Daffne -LRB- 50 -RRB- . Officials have been able to get the address of Brett Tailor -LRB- 49 -RRB- , a resident of Australia.devraj.dasgupta@timesgroup.com . `` The hotel is under our control , '' JK Dutt , chief of the National Security Guard commandos , said Saturday , Nov. 29 , after fierce combat that began early in the morning and lasted nearly five hours . . . Dutt added that the commandoes had killed three terrorists after an intense gun battle inside the hotel . One commando was killed during the assault in the 565-room hotel . Some 200 national security guards were involved in the operation . . . Through Friday night , the terrorists engaged in intermittent battles . Dutt said terrorists had set fires at different places in the hotel as diversionary tactics whenever they found the forces closing in on them . . . Security forces still had to complete their final searches of the hotels . . `` There was a lot of shooting . Grenades were lobbed and explosives were used by terrorists , '' he said . . . The security chief said operations would be declared over only after the conclusion of room-to-room searches to ensure that there were no remaining terrorists or live explosives inside the LOC_Event . . . `` We are also looking for surviving guests who could have locked themselves in rooms and have not been coming out for fear of terrorists , '' he said . . . Rescue operations at hotels , Jewish center . . In all , nearly 200 people have been killed since Wednesday night when a group of militants carried out a series of coordinated attacks in India 's commercial capital . At least 22 of the dead were non-Indian national . Several hundred more people have been injured . . . The terrorists reportedly targeted individuals carrying British and American passports . Five Americans and one British citizen have been reported among the foreign victims . . . In addition to other sites , the gunmen had seized the Taj and the Oberoi-Trident , both five-star hotels , and a Jewish center in southern Mumbai . . . The National Security Guard and military commandoes on Friday managed to end the siege at the Oberoi-Trident hotel and the Jewish center by killing two militants in each operation . . . The horror began Wednesday evening with coordinated attacks at multiple locations . . At least 30 bodies were found at the hotel , 20 of whom were massacred in one of the restaurants , officials said . Five hostages were murdered by militants at the Jewish center . . . Tension rises between India , Pakistan . . A previously unknown group calling itself the Decca Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the attacks -- the worst in Mumbai since more than 180 people were killed in a series of bombings in 2006 . . . Indian security agencies have said they suspect that Pakistan-based militant groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba had a hand in the carnage . On Friday , Delhi blamed `` elements '' in Pakistan for the attacks . . . Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee told visiting Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi that `` outrages '' like the Mumbai attack would make progress in the bilateral peace process `` impossible . '' . Ranchi , Nov. 28 : It was 1.35 pm . Numb with pain , friends and family members of Malayesh Banerjee watched IC 809 touch down at Birsa Munda Airport . They knew it had arrived . . . Colleagues Ketan Parekh and Saurav Kumar , and family friend Prasenjit Kumar were accompanying the body of the 27-year-old architect , killed in one of the worst terror attacks in LOC_Event on Wednesday . . . Father Madhabendra Banerjee the head of chemistry department at Ranchi University perhaps for the first time fumbled for an answer when someone asked where the coffin was and how it would be taken home . . . As the others wondered what to do , an airport employee directed them to an ambulance parked near the side gate on the premises . . . Soon , a red and white trolley carrying the black coffin appeared . Madhabendra broke down . The coffin was put in ambulance . It left the airport at 2.02 pm and reached the Banerjee residence at Old Commissioners Compound , behind Lionel Edward Bengali Boys School , 20 minutes later . . . For a moment , there was silence . . . As the ambulance stopped , a group of hysterical women rushed towards the vehicle . They were followed by an inconsolable Mridula , Malayeshs mother . A family friend said doctors had had to give sedatives to soothe her frayed nerves . . . After a half-an-hour stay , Malayeshs body was taken on its final journey to the Harmu crematorium . . . It was a heartrending scene . Madhabendra could barely walk to the pyre . Finally , Malayeshs maternal uncle , Pradeep Banerjee , had to complete the last rites , said a neighbour . . . This is the most unfortunate day of my life . I am lighting the pyre of the boy who once played on my lap . I wish I could challenge destiny , Pradeep told The Telegraph . . . Colleague Ketan said that Malayesh would not have died had he stayed a little longer at office . . . He took the bullet hardly 20 minutes after he left our office at Nariman Point . He was rushed to hospital , but could not be saved , he said . . . The Bishop Westcott Boys School in Namkum , Malayeshs alma mater , today mourned his death . Students observed silence for two minutes and prayed that his soul may rest in peace . . . Several dignitaries , including former state chief minister Arjun Munda , visited the Banerjee residence later in the day to condole his death . . . PUCL state vice-president Tridib Ghosh also sent a condolence message to the bereaved Banerjee family . A day after the terror attack on the historic LOC_Event which left over hundred killed , services on the Central Railways were restored to normal on Thursday , officials said.Three railway officials , including senior inspector of CST Government Railway Police ( GRP ) Shashank Shinde and head constable of the Railway Protection Force M L Chaudhary , were killed in the shootout.The other Central Railway employee killed in the attack was Assisting Chief Ticket Officer S K Sharma . `` We resumed services around 0230 hours after conducting combing operations to ensure it was safe , '' Chief Public Relations Officer ( Central Railways ) Shriniwas Mudgerikar said.High security was present at all railway stations on the Central Railway line , he said.The total number of persons killed in the attack has not yet been ascertained , officials said . . . . NEW DELHI The exchanges are chilling . Skip to next paragraphRelatedTimes Topics : Terrorism in IndiaDocument : Copy of the Dossier ( External link ) The hostages are of use only as long as you do not come under fire , a supervisor instructed gunmen by phone during the LOC_Event attacks in November . He added : If you are still threatened , then dont saddle yourself with the burden of the hostages . Immediately kill them.A gunman replied , Yes , we shall do accordingly , God willing . These are some of the grim details of the LOC_Event attacks compiled by the Indian authorities and officially shared with the Pakistani government on Monday . The compilation seems intended to achieve at least two objectives for India : demonstrate that the attackers were sent from Pakistan , and rally international support for Indias efforts to press Pakistan on its handling of terrorism suspects . To that end , the dossier , a copy of which was shown to The New York Times , includes previously undisclosed transcripts of telephone conversations , intercepted by Indian authorities , that the 10 gunmen had during their killing spree . They left 163 dead , all the while receiving instructions and pep talks from their handlers across the border.The dossier also includes photographs of materials found on the fishing trawler the gunmen took to LOC_Event : a bottle of Mountain Dew soda packaged in Karachi , pistols bearing the markings of a gun manufacturer in Peshawar , Pakistani-made items like a matchbox , detergent powder and shaving cream.Beyond that , the dossier chronicles Indias efforts in recent years to persuade Pakistan to investigate suspects involved in terrorist attacks in India and to close terrorist training camps inside Pakistani territory . In the final pages , India demands that Pakistan hand over conspirators to face trial in India and comply with its promise to stop terrorist groups from functioning inside its territory . The dossier was shown this week to diplomats from friendly nations ; one described it as comprehensive , another as convincing.Although the dossier takes pains not to blame current or former officials in Pakistans army or spy agency , Indian officials have consistently hinted at their complicity , at least in training the commando-style fighters who carried out the attack . On Tuesday , the Indian prime minister , Manmohan Singh , upped the ante , but stopped short of naming any specific entities or individuals . There is enough evidence to show that , given the sophistication and military precision of the attack , it must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan , he said.Pakistan on Tuesday rejected the Indian allegation . Scoring points like this will only move us further away from focusing on the very real and present danger of regional and global terrorism , Sherry Rehman , Pakistans information minister , said in a statement , according to Reuters . It is our firm resolve to ensure that nonstate actors do not use Pakistani soil to launch terrorist attacks anywhere in the world.Pakistan has said it is examining the information sent by India.The dossier narrates a journey of zeal , foibles and careful planning , one whose blow-by-blow news coverage was followed by handlers , believed to be in Pakistan , and used to caution the gunmen about the movement of Indian security forces and to motivate them to keep fighting.Everything is being recorded by the media . Inflict the maximum damage . Keep fighting . Dont be taken alive , a caller said to a gunman in the Oberoi Hotel in the early hours of the three-day rampage.Throw one or two grenades at the Navy and police teams , which are outside , came one instruction to the gunmen inside the Taj Mahal hotel.Keep two magazines and three grenades aside and expend the rest of your ammunition , went another set of instructions to the attackers inside Nariman House , which housed an Orthodox Jewish center.At the Taj Mahal , the attackers were asked by their counselors whether they had set the hotel on fire ; one attacker said he was preparing a mattress for that purpose . At the Oberoi , an attacker asked whether to spare women ( Kill them , came the terse reply ) and Muslims ( he was told to release them and kill the rest ) . At Nariman House , they were told that Indias standing with a major ally , Israel , might be damaged.If the hostages are killed , it will spoil relations between India and Israel , one handler said.According to the investigation into the attack , the 10 gunmen boarded a small boat in Karachi at 8 a.m. on Nov. 22 , sailed a short distance before boarding a bigger carrier believed to be owned by an important operative of a banned Pakistan-based terrorist group , Lashkar-e-Taiba . The next day , the 10 men took over an Indian fishing trawler , killed four crew members , and sailed 550 nautical miles along the Arabian Sea.Each man carried a weapons pack : a Kalashnikov , a 9-millimeter pistol , ammunition , hand grenades and a bomb containing a military-grade explosive , steel ball bearings and a timer with instructions inscribed in Urdu.By 4 p.m. on Nov. 26 , the trawler approached the shores of LOC_Event . The leader of the crew , identified by Indian investigators as Ismail Khan , 25 , from a Pakistani town in the Northwest-Frontier Province , contacted his handlers . When darkness set in , the men killed the trawlers captain and boarded a dinghy , with an engine that investigators said bore marks from a Lahore-based importing company . They reached LOC_Event about 8:30 p.m. , and in five teams of two , set upon their targets : Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus , known as Victoria Terminus , the citys busiest railway station ; a tourist haunt called the Leopold Cafe ; the Jewish center in Nariman House ; and the Taj Mahal and Oberoi hotels.They made one mistake , investigators said . They left behind Mr. Khans satellite phone ; it was recovered by Indian investigators and its photograph was included in the dossier . A GPS device was also recovered from the trawler.The last telephone transcript in the dossier was at 10:26 p.m. on Nov. 27 , between a gunman inside Nariman House and his interlocutor . Brother you have to fight , the caller said . This is a matter of the prestige of Islam.By the morning of Nov. 29 , Indian forces had killed nine of the fighters.The sole survivor , Muhammad Ajmal Kasab , is in the custody of the Mumbai police . His interrogation turned up one of the most frightening details : he was part of a cadre of 32 would-be suicide bombers , later joined by three more men . Ten went to LOC_Event . Six went to Indian-administered Kashmir , Mr. Kasab told his interrogators . The dossier says nothing about what happened to the remaining trainees . Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from Islamabad , Pakistan.More Articles in World A version of this article appeared in print on January 7 , 2009 , on page A5 of the New York edition . . BELLARY/BANGALORE : Four Kashmiri youths have been taken into custody in Hampi in connection with the February 13 explosion in LOC_Event that left 11 persons dead . The detention was made by a team of the Maharashtra police near Virupapura Gaddi locality . The LOC_Event blast site was littered with handicrafts items , leading the Mumbai police to Hampi . The four Kashmiris are sellers of handicrafts . The police are looking for three other persons , according to sources . Dozens of other detentions have been made in Bangalore , Mumbai and Pune on the basis of intelligence , call records and whatever ` little information ' sleuths could glean from the CCTV footage containing images of activities on North Main Road , where the German Bakery 's entrance is located . But superintendent of police Seemanth Kumar Singh denied the arrest of anybody in connection with the Pune blast . Another SP , Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar , told TOI no arrest or detentions had been made . ` Neither we nor any other state police force has arrested or detained anyone . '' The Maharashtra police team inspected various cyber cafes in Hampi , a popular haunt for foreign tourists . They questioned some foreigners , and enquired with the local police and hotel owners about people who had booked rooms for a week and left in a hurry . The police have visited some of the villages surrounding Hampi . More than 40 hotels catering to foreign tourists are located in Hampi . Three years ago , a suspected terrorist , Bilal , from Kashmir , was arrested in Bangalore . An LeT operative , he had planned to attack the Bengaluru International Airport and Wipro and Infosys offices . Late last August , Indias intelligence services listened in as two Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives discussed plans to attack targets in LOC_Event . . . No evidence has yet emerged to link the timer-controlled , directional improvised explosive device that went off in LOC_Event on Saturday to Pakistan-backed jihadist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba . But Indias intelligence services believe that call and a mass of other indications suggest they were the most likely perpetrators of the bombing of the LOC_Event . . . Jihadist operations . . Long before Lashkar Deputy Chief held out threats of attacks against LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event in a February 5 speech , a mass of jihadist operations had been detected . . . In mid-2009 , Karachi-based jihadist Mohammad Khwaja recently handed over by Sri Lankan authorities to India is believed to have planned a bombing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs offices in Kolkata to coincide with the Lok Sabha elections . . . Khalid Sardana , a Poonch-based Lashkar operative who played a key role in raising recruits for the organisation , was arrested late last year while attempting to rebuild western India networks he had constructed for the terrorist group while studying at a Gujarat seminary . . . The Karachi Project . . Lashkar commanders , evidence presented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in support of the prosecution of Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley suggests , were at an advanced stage of planning attacks in LOC_Event and LOC_Event Headley also spoke of what he called the Karachi Project : a Lashkar unit dedicated to using Pakistan-based Indian operatives to stage a renewed series of attacks . . . In Karachi , fugitive Indian Mujahideen leaders Riyaz Ismail Shahbandari , his brother Iqbal Shahbandari and Abdul Subhan Qureshi were believed to be preparing the ground for these attacks , possibly in alliance with long-standing Lashkar operatives from Maharashtra , like Zabiuddin Ansari and Rahil Sheikh . . . The LOC_Event cell . . Investigators are focussing their attentions on the prospect that the attacks were carried out by a Pune jihad cell known to have existed since at least 2006 . Much of the story of the cell emerged from the questioning of Mohammad Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy , an Indian Mujahideen operative held in the course of a national counter-terrorism operation that targeted the Lashkar-linked group in 2008 . . . Having graduated from Pune University in 1998 , Peerbhoy developed a successful career as a software engineer . He served for over a decade with the offshore operations of several United States-based companies , before he was hired as a web services engineer by Yahoo . . . But like many upwardly mobile professionals , Peerbhoy found himself dislocated by the westernised social milieu he found themselves in and turned to religion . In June , 2004 , he travelled with his father a major contractor of fruit to the Indian Armys western command for the Haj pilgrimage . Later , he began studying Arabic and religion with the Quran Foundation , a prominent religious organisation that steered clear of politics . . . In October , 2006 , during a 10-day spiritual retreat at the LOC_Event in LOC_Event , Peerbhoy ran into an associate from his Quran Foundation classes who helped alter his world view . Local resident Asif Bashar Sheikh introduced Peerbhoy to Islamism . The young computer engineer began discussing the conflicts in LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event , as well as communal violence in India . . . Later , in the spring of 2007 , though , Peerbhoy was introduced to the Indian Mujahideens key operational commander , Riyaz Shahbandri , and his brother , ideologue Iqbal Shahbandri . Based out of a rented flat off Ashoka Mews in Punes Khondva area , the two men sons of an affluent Mumbai-based tannery owner , who had migrated to the city from Bhatkal , near Mangalore ran a secret jihadist group which called itself Isabah . . . Early on , Peerbhoy was tasked with setting up a website for IsabahArabic for the companions of the Prophet Mohammad . The plan was dropped , but Peerbhoy was paid to attend a courses on internet security to help the organisation communicate safely . Later , on a business visit to the United States , he purchased equipment police say was intended to help the organisation evade espionage and locate unsecured wireless networks . The hacked wireless networks were used to send out manifestos claiming responsibility for bombings in LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . . Late in August , 2008 , the Bhatkal brothers returned to Mangalore a decision which allowed them to evade the police who arrested Peerbhoy and other members of the Pune jihad cell later that year . However , several members of the Indian Mujahideen network in the city , notably Mohsin Chowdhury , also succeeded in escaping . Police believe the Bhatkal brothers may also have recruited other LOC_Event residents who Peerbhoy and his associates were never introduced to . . . Escalating threat . . Indian intelligence analysis believe that these networks are being revived because the international pressure which compelled Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate to clamp down on jihadist operations after the November , 2008 carnage in Mumbai has waned . . . Even as the United States seeks a deal with Afghanistan and Pakistan-based Islamists , Pakistans ISI appears to have been testing Indias responses to violence from the jihadist groups it backs . In October , 2009 , jihadists linked to the networks of Afghan warlord Jalaluddin Haqqani widely believed to be a close ally of Pakistans ISI attempted to bomb Indias Embassy in LOC_Event , killing 19 people . Later in the winter , tensions escalated along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir , and rockets were fired across the India-Punjab border . After a detailed review of the internal security situation in the wake of bomb blast in LOC_Event , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday directed the Union and Maharashtra governments to take coordinated and effective action to speedily investigate the terror attack . . . Dr. Singh who discussed the situation with Home Minister P. Chidambaram , directed speedy investigation so that the culprits responsible for this heinous act are identified and brought to justice at the earliest , a spokesman of the Prime Ministers Office said . The Prime Minister was briefed by the Home Minister about investigations being carried out in LOC_Event in the aftermath of the blast on Saturday . . . The Prime Minister expressed his deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of all those killed and injured in the incident and announced relief from the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund of Rs . 2 lakh to the next of kin of those killed , and Rs . 1 lakh to those injured . He said that the government would extend whatever help was required by the families of those killed and injured in the incident . . . Earlier in the day , Mr. Chidambaram presided over a high-level meeting in the Home Ministry which reviewed the security situation across the country in the wake of LOC_Event bomb blast in which nine persons were killed and 32 injured . . . The Home Ministry sounded an alert in three cities - Delhi , Kanpur and Indore - following inputs from intelligence agencies that public places in these cities may be on the radar screen of terrorists . The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- is scheduled to hold its three-day national executive meeting in Indore from February 17 . . . We have intelligence inputs that terrorists may target Delhi , Kanpur and Indore . We have shared the information with all concerned and asked the state governments to take necessary action , a Home Ministry official said . . . A general advisory has already been sent to all states asking them to take necessary security steps in crowded localities , railway stations , bus terminals , vital installations , airports and other places . . . Preliminary probe has revealed that RDX and ammonium nitrate were used in the explosion that ripped through German bakery in LOC_Event . . . The high-level security review meeting at the Home Ministry was attended by the National Security Adviser Shiv Shanker Menon , Home Secretary G.K. Pillai , RAW chief K.C. Verma , IB Director Rajiv Mathur and other senior officials of the Ministry . Even as Maharashtra police investigators said little progress was made in identifying the perpetrators of Saturdays bombing of the LOC_Event in LOC_Event , an unknown Pakistan-based jihadist group has claimed responsibility for the attack that claimed 10 lives . . . Identifying himself as a spokesperson on behalf of a group calling itself the Lashkar-e-Taiba al-Almi , an individual using the code-name Abu Jindal said the bombing was carried out because of Indias refusal to discuss the Kashmir issue in the coming talks with Pakistan . . . Abu Jindal said he was calling from Miramshah in North Waziristan , and the telephone number used to make the call carried an area code common to the Waziristan tribal area and Bannu , the adjoining district in the North-West Frontier Province . When The Hindu tried calling back , though , a recorded voice message said the number was temporarily not in use . . . No past communiqu was issued by the Lashkar-e-Taiba al-Almi , and terrorism experts in New Delhi told The Hindu that no such group was known to exist . . . However , the caller who appeared to be educated said the group had split from the Lashkar-e-Taiba because it took orders from Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence . . . Earlier , al-Qaeda affiliated jihadist leader Illyas Kashmiri was reported to have sent an e-mail to a Pakistani journalist , claiming responsibility for the attack . . . Indian intelligence sources said the claims appeared intended to deflect attention from the Lashkar-e-Taiba , which is emerging as the principal suspect for the attack . In the wake of the Lashkars 2008 attack on Mumbai , Pakistan had come under intense pressure to dismantle the terrorist group as well as its political-religious organisation , the Jamaat-ud-Dawa . It has , however , rejected international calls for such action . Despite official claims , Maharashtra police sources say there is little evidence as yet to link the bombing of the LOC_Event with any perpetrator . It comes as senior officials from India and Pakistan plan to meet in New Delhi on February 25 to resume talks suspended in the wake of the deadly Mumbai assault , which was blamed on Pakistani-based fighters . . . Dilip Band , another police official , said `` the explosive was in a bag kept in the bakery '' and that four foreign women were among the dead buttheir nationalities were not immediately known.Indian mediareported thatthetoll of thoseinjured could rise . ` Intelligence alert ` Al Jazeera 's Prerna Suri , reporting from NewDelhi , said the explosion was so strong that the entire restauranthad been destroyed . . .

'' . . The authoritiesinitially blamedthe blaston an cooking-gas cylinder which exploded , but they later said they suspected it was a `` terror attack '' . `` It 's a suspectedterrorist attack ... because it appears the bomb blast arose from an unattended package which was left behind in the bakery , '' GK Pillai , India 's interior secretary , told Al Jazeera . `` The whole country has been put on high alert.A team from theCBI [ Central Bureau of Investigation ) will be shortly on its way from Delhi to assist the Mumbai policeteam in the investigation of this blast . '' . . ThePress Trust of India news agencyquoted an unnamed official source as saying the blast wascaused by an improvised explosive device.Maharashtra police said an investigation was under way to establish the cause of the explosion.The site of the Pune blast was close toChabad House , a Jewish cultural andreligious centre run by the orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch movement whosemembers were targeted in the Mumbai attacks.Pune is about 100km southeast of Mumbai , India 's commercial capital . . . . As Union Home Secretary G K Pillai confirmed that David Coleman Headley , arrested by the FBI for plotting a major terror attack in LOC_Event at the behest of the Lashkar-e-Toiba , had visited the country , including Mumbai , several times , official sources said the government has now decided on prior clearances for visas to American citizens of Pakistani origin . . . Sources said that Headley , a Pakistani national who acquired US citizenship after changing his name from Daood Gilani , travelled to LOC_Event on business visas nine times between 2006 and 2009 . . . And Pillai , responding to queries from reporters today , said : `` We do know that Headley had visited LOC_Event a number of times . That is being investigated ... He has been in Mumbai and some other places . '' . . Security agencies are looking into Headley 's visits to `` several cities '' and say it is too early to say whether these were linked to the 26/11 terror strike in Mumbai . . . Official sources said Headley was suspected to have set-up an extensive network , particularly in Maharashtra , Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh , using the cover of a businessman . . . Although the government is awaiting the return of Intelligence officials who had gone to interrogate Headley and his associate Tahawwur Hussain Rana , alarm bells are already ringing in the internal security establishment with immigration records being dug out to get hold of the full picture . . . As a first step , the government , sources said , will inform the Americans that visas to its nationals of Pakistani origin will only be given after prior clearances . The government believes that Daood Gilani deliberately acquired a Christian name and American passport to avoid detection in India . . . Headley was arrested last month at Chicago 's O'Hare airport as he prepared to board a flight to Philadelphia , intending to travel to Pakistan . Siddhesh Inamdar and Rahi Gaikwad . . CCTV footage from hotel opposite German Bakery obtained ; 2 foreigners among 9 dead . . PUNE/MUMBAI : Even as a breakthrough in the Saturdays blast at the LOC_Event in LOC_Event eluded the police , the Maharashtra government on Sunday reviewed the security arrangements in Nagpur , Aurangabad and Nashik , besides Mumbai . It also ordered the tightening of security for American and Israeli establishments across the State . . . In LOC_Event , Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh told reporters on Sunday : No one has yet been detained . I also can not say about any involvement of the Indian Mujahideen at this point . It was too premature to comment if there was a pattern with the other blasts in the country , he said . . . Special Inspector-General , Law and Order , Rashmi Shukla , told journalists in Mumbai on Sunday : There was no CCTV camera in the LOC_Event . However , O Hotel , located opposite , had CCTVs , which covered the frontal area of the bakery . The ATS -LSB- Anti-Terrorism Squad -RSB- has that footage . . . An unclaimed bag was found under the table . A waiter was asked to remove the bag . Before he could remove it , the explosion took place . The blast left a hole of six feet by four feet in the bakery wall , Ms. Shukla said . . . Of the nine people killed in the blast , two were identified as foreigners Saied Abdulkhani -LRB- 26 -RRB- , an Iranian ; and Nadia Macerini -LRB- 37 -RRB- , an Italian . While Abdulkhani was a student of the Ferguson College in LOC_Event , Ms. Macerini was visiting the Osho International Meditation Centre , about 200 yards from the German Bakery . . . The rest of the casualties were students and employed youths . They were identified as : Ankik Dhar -LRB- 24 -RRB- from Kolkata ; his sister Anandi Dhar -LRB- 19 -RRB- ; P. Sindhuri -LRB- 22 -RRB- from Bangalore ; Vinita Gadani -LRB- 22 -RRB- from Mumbai ; Shilpa Goenka -LRB- 23 -RRB- from Kolkata ; Shankar Pansare -LRB- 40 -RRB- from LOC_Event in LOC_Event district ; and Gokul Nepali -LRB- 30 -RRB- , a waiter at the LOC_Event . . . Of the 60 injured -LRB- 46 men and 14 women -RRB- , 19 were discharged from hospitals . The injured include 12 foreigners : five from Iran , two each from Sudan and Nepal , and one each from Yemen , Taiwan and Germany . . . A day after the blast , the Bakery , one of the citys popular tourist landmarks , stood deserted . The road leading up to it was cordoned off . . . Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram visited the blast site during the day . He refuted suggestions that the government had not taken intelligence inputs seriously . . . He said : There is no intelligence failure . The State government had taken the advice seriously and the police put in place security measures in the hard targets . PUNE : Terror struck LOC_Event this evening when a powerful bomb ripped apart a popular bakery near a Jewish prayer house , killing eight people , including a foreigner , and injuring 32 in the first major attack since 26/11 carnage . . . The improvised explosive device , kept in an unattended packet outside the kitchen of the German bakery , exploded at around 7.30 pm when a waiter attempted to open it . . . `` It is most probably a terror attack . Forensic experts of CBI and team of National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) officials are being airlifted to LOC_Event to assist the state police in the investigations , '' Union Home Secretary G K Pillai said . . . The German bakery is a favourite food joint for foreigners , located close to Osho Ashram which had been surveyed by Pakistani-origin American David Coleman Headley , a Lashkar-e Taiba operative . . . Quoting information from the state government , Pillai said eight people had died and 32 were injured in the blast . One each of the killed and the injured are foreigners , he said , but could not give the nationality . . . The rest , he said , were believed to be Indians but the situation could change . . . Asked whether Pakistani hand was suspected behind the attack , Pillai said he could not say anything till forensic examination was over . . . Home Minister P Chidambaram , who is in Tamil Nadu , will visit LOC_Event tomorrow . He is closely monitoring the situation and the position is being reviewed periodically . . . The Home Ministry has issued an alert across the country asking people not to open any unattended object and to inform the police if they find any suspicious object . . . Pillai said the Union Home Ministry had issued an advisory to Maharashtra government informing it that the Osho Ashram was one of the sites surveyed by Headley . . . Headley , who was arrested by FBI at Chicago airport last year when he proceeding to board a flight to Pakistan , had visited a number of places in India , including the Mumbai terror attack targets . . .

It has asked the State Government to tighten security at important places of worship in the State and has also advised a security vigil in Bangalore . Mr. Ashok said the Home Department will provide tight security for the elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats to ensure free and fair polling . In addition to security at the polling stations , steps would be taken to ensure that law and order is not disrupted , he noted . The Home Department has conducted several rounds of discussions in this regard with top-ranking police officers . . . Liquor sales . . Sources said that steps are being taken to ensure that the poll norms do not come in the way of liquor sales in Bangalore during Christmas and the New Year Eve . . . It is learnt that the Police Department will take up the issue with the State Election Commission as the panchayat elections are not being held in Bangalore . . . Meanwhile , some Christian organisations are learnt to have represented to the Home Department seeking that the ban on liquor sales should not be imposed on Christmas Day . . . The State Government is said to be of the view that the Election Commission should relax the model code of conduct in cities where elections are not being held . . . It follows a Union Home Ministry advisory Union Government advises security vigil in Bangalore . The long-pending proposals for up-gradation of the existing security mechanism at the famous Sri Seetharamachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam have once again come into sharp focus in the aftermath of the bomb blast at the temple city of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday . . . Dog squad . . Sources say that the security agencies concerned have issued instructions to the personnel manning the temple to remain vigilant to prevent untoward incidents during the ensuing Vaikunta Ekadasi festival , which attracts thousands of devotees to the shrine . . . A dog squad has also been deployed at the temple as part of heightened security measures . . . However , the deficiencies in the existing security mechanism , particularly the inadequate number of security personnel and lack of sophisticated security devices , have become a cause for concern . . . The temple security is being manned by the Special Protection Force consisting of two head constables and nine constables , in association with the town police . . . Foolproof plan . . In an effort to revamp the security set-up at the temple , the authorities concerned have drawn up a foolproof security plan and sent the proposals to the government for up-gradation of the whole security system at the temple long ago , sources added . . . The plan envisages enhancement of the security and surveillance mechanism , including strengthening of the existing CCTV camera system , and appointment of a SI rank officer to head the SPF team at the temple . The Popular Front of India -LRB- PFI -RRB- has strongly condemned the bomb blast which took place in Varanasi on December 7 . . . In a press release here on Friday , PFI Udupi district unit president Niyamath Ali said that the blast was a senseless and a shameful act . It was done with the purpose for creating terror among people and disturbing inter-community relations . . . Such acts were intended to weaken the people 's united struggle for justice on the Babri Masjid issue . HYDERABAD : Not leaving anything to chance in the aftermath of LOC_Event bomb blast , the state intelligence has alerted the police commissionerates in Hyderabad and Cyberabad on possible attacks on Western nationals , especially those hailing from Holland , by terror groups . According to a departmental memo 425/CI/2010 dated December 6 , the intelligence wing has come to know of an exchange of SMSes that speak against the anti-Islam Dutch film ` Fitna ' -LRB- Devilry -RRB- made by right-wing politician Geert Wilders . One of the SMSes , the circular said , was ` Remember Allah may ask you one day what did you do when they made fun of My messenger ? ' Senior police officers , however , denied issuing any circular specifically mentioning Dutch nationals . The circular deals with general alert against the backdrop of Varanasi terrorist attack , they added . Some police officers said the circular related to Dutch nationals emanated from the central intelligence agencies and was not specific to Hyderabad . The circular is the result of Wilder 's recent tour of Israel where he was promoting his short film and demanding a campaign for banning the Muslim holy book ` The Koran . ' Police officers fear that hate-mongering against one group of people could provoke some to take law into their hands . Varanasi : Terror struck this holy town when a low-intensity blast ripped through a crowded bathing ghat on the banks of the Ganges river during evening prayers killing a child and injuring 37 people , including six foreigners . . . Banned terror outfit Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) claimed responsibility for the blast in e-mails sent to media houses and said it ` attributed ' the attack to the demolition of LOC_Event in 1992 . . . Home Secretary G K Pillai said the Government believes that the blast , which also led to a stampede , was a terror strike . Some people were injured in the stampede , police said . . . A 11-month-old girl identified as Swastika Sharma , who was with her mother for the prayers , died at Marwari hospital after the blast , according to IG ( Varanasi ) R P Singh . . . Pillai had earlier said roughly between '20 to 25 persons ' were injured . Later in the night , hospital officials said 37 people were injured , including six foreigners . . . Officials said 20 injured were admitted to BHU Hospital , 13 in Kabir Chaura Hospital and four in Heritage Hospital . . . Among the injured foreigners was an Italian , Alexandeo Mantello , who was now out of danger , police said . According to hospital sources , the others were French national Rachael , Ki Taro from Japan , South Korean Wan Sen Kim , Italian national Lydia de Mayo and German national Ozel . . . The blast occurred at around 6:20 pm when thousands of devotees and some foreign tourists had assembled at the Dashashwamedh ghat for having darshan of the Ganga Arti ritual , police sources said . . . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm . Several cities including the national capital were put on high alert . . . Additional Director General Law and Order Brijlal told reporters in Lucknow that the blast took place due to ` some explosive material ' kept on the stairs of the ghat . . . The blast occurred at a spot some two km away from Sankatmochan Temple which was targeted by terrorists in 2006 . . . ` According to the information that we have , it was a low intensity blast which occurred around 6.20 PM , ' Pillai said in New Delhi . But Secretary ( Internal Security ) U K Bansal said the explosion was a ` medium intensity ' blast . Some people suffered injuries due to the blast while some were hurt during the stampede which occurred due to the collapse of a railing . Some of the injured persons were reported to have been hurt by metal pellets . . . Official sources in New Delhi said that an Improvised Explosive Device ( IED ) was recovered from a metal dustbin at the site of the blast . . . Eyewitnesses said a loud noise which also shook some nearby buildings was heard when the explosion occurred . . . ADG ( Law and Order ) Brij Lal told reporters in Lucknow that the explosive was planted in the wall between the Dashashwamedh and Shitla ghats and most of the persons suffered injuries due to stone splinters . . . He said the baby girl fell from the lap of her mother after the blast and succumbed to injuries in hospital . . . Forensic teams were airlifted from Agra and rushed to LOC_Event for detailed investigations , the ADG said . . . On the Indian Mujahideen e-mail , Brij Lal said that it would be probed threadbare . . . He , however , said that there was no specific warning in the e-mail for today as the one that is being referred to was for the anniversary of Babri mosque demolition yesterday . . . LOC_Event , which was rocked by twin blasts on March seven in 2006 in which 20 persons were killed , has been under constant threat from various terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ) . . . Senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi , who represents LOC_Event in the Lok Sabha , said there seemed to be a ` motive ' behind the blast since it occurred during prayer time . In Delhi , Union Home Minister P Chidambaram said , ` Government condemns the attempt to disturb the peace and harmony by a misguided group which appears to have planted a low-intensity device in one of the ghats in LOC_Event . ' . . The authenticity of the IM claim is being verified , he said . . . Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati visited the blast site late in the night . . . She said the Central government should make security forces and equipment available to Uttar Pradesh , especially for LOC_Event , the way it had done after the 26/11 terror strikes in Mumbai . . . She will write a letter to the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister in this regard tomorrow , Mayawati said . . . Earlier in the evening , she had held an emergency meeting of senior government officials in Lucknow and sent a team of officials , besides BSP state unit president Swami Prasad Maurya , to LOC_Event . . . Meanwhile , officials said forensic teams reached the site late in the night and collected samples . VARANASI : The low-intensity bomb used in the blast here did not have shrapnels in it and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion , police sources said on Wednesday . They said the bomb kept near the steps leading to the LOC_Event was placed in such a way that the maximum impact was directed to the ground where the ` arti ' was being held on Tuesday evening . Though the nature of explosives is yet to be ascertained , the sources said there were no burn or shrapnel injuries . Meanwhile , of the 37 injured in the blasts , one is said to be in a critical condition . Forensic experts are examining the blast scene to find clues about the exact nature of the explosives used . An improvised explosive device -LRB- IED -RRB- was recovered from a metal dustbin at the site of the blast . Banned terror outfit Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- has claimed responsibility for the blast in e-mails sent to media houses and said it ` attributed ' the attack to the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 . The blast occurred at 6:20 pm when thousands of devotees and some foreign tourists had assembled at the ghat for the Ganga arti ritual . The blast left a child dead and 37 others injured . New Delhi Islamist militants are being blamed for an explosion that killed at least one person and wounded more than 20 others at one of Hinduisms holiest sites Tuesday evening . . . The blast went off during a Hindu ceremony by the river Ganges in Varanasi , an ancient pilgrimage city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh at around 6:45 pm . Police were immediately put on high alert in Indias big cities . . . Several television channels and newspapers said they had received e-mails from an Islamist militant group , the Indian Mujahadeen ( IM ) , claiming it was behind the blast . . . The official investigation is just beginning . But Indian security pundits say the IM is an obvious suspect : The group has carried out a string of bombings in Indian cities , most recently in the southern city of Pune this February . It is linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who were behind the Mumbai attacks of 2008 . . . A police officer told local journalists a bomb appeared to have been hidden in a container on one of the ghats stone staircases that lead down to the Ganges , where people gather to say their prayers and bathe , particularly at sunrise and sunset . . . The bomb is thought to have killed a baby girl and injured at least 20 more , including an unknown number of foreigners . . . Perhaps Indias holiest city , LOC_Event also known by its older name of Benares is always packed with Hindu pilgrims and foreign tourists . . . Some analysts say the IM is focusing on foreigners . The group was suspected of involvement in machine gun attack on tourists in the capital , New Delhi that wounded two foreigners in September , in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games . . . An offshoot of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India , the IM first emerged in 2007 and 2008 . Intelligence officials allege its operatives are being trained in Pakistan . They also say its threat has been reduced in recent months thanks to successful security operations . . . Police have been especially vigilant in Uttar Pradesh in recent months , following a controversial ruling over a religious site that has long divided Indias Hindu majority and Muslim minority . In September , a high court in the state ruled that a site in the town of Ayodhya should be divided between Hindu and Muslims groups , with the majority share going to Hindus . . . In 1992 , Hindu zealots had torn down a 17th century mosque at the site , unleashing India-wide riots that killed 2,000 people , most of them Muslim . . . The issue of the Babri Masjid ( mosque ) has lost some of its power to mobilize mass unrest in recent years . Indias Muslim community , though long marginalized and discriminated against , has been largely peaceful . Despite fears of a backlash after Septembers ruling , the state remained peaceful in the aftermath of the ruling . . . LOC_Event is no stranger to militant attacks . In March 2006 , twin bombings blamed on a Pakistan-based Islamist militant group tore through a LOC_Event and a LOC_Event in the city , killing 20 people . . . . The all too familiar blame game has begun between the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh and the Centre , with both blaming each other for the intelligence failure that led to Tuesday 's blast in Varanasi.Union home minister P. Chidambaram , who visited the spot and met blast victims , shifted the responsibility on the state saying it was a failure on the part of the UP government.The state ignored specific warnings which were issued about terrorists planning an attack on Varanasi 's ghats . We had also sent a letter to the UP government on February 25 , 2010 to share intelligence reports hinting at the possibility of terrorist outfits targeting this particular ghat of Varanasi , Chidambaram said.Since the warning had been conveyed to the state government in advance and that too specifically about a possible strike at Dasashwamedh Ghat , we expected them to take appropriate security measures . It was the result of some security lapse on the part of the state administration , he added.Chidambaram also sounded a grim warning that we should not underestimate the nature of the threat.The retaliation from the state was swift . Hitting back at the Centre , state cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh said , We had not got any such specific information . The home minister is misleading . The Centre had given routine and general information during Dushehra . But there was no specific information about the ghats.In fact it is the responsibility of the Centre to tackle terrorist activities . The states neither have expertise nor enough force to handle such situations , he added.However , earlier in the day , chief minister Mayawati chose to stay away from the blame game allowing her bureaucrats to do the needful.It 's time to fight terrorism jointly . There should n't be any politics on this issue , the chief minister said , but could n't resist adding the Centre does n't give us sufficient force.The investigating agencies , meanwhile , are groping in the dark after the powerful blast at LOC_Event , adjacent to Dasashwamedh Ghat , left one girl dead and over three dozen seriously wounded . Some agencies had wrongly reported about the death of an Italian tourist , who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Varanasi.The Anti-Terrorist Squad ( ATS ) of the UP Police and central intelligence agencies , including the Intelligence Bureau have cordoned off the area.But they have neither found any trace of a timer or any device or even an electric wire which could have been used to trigger the blast.They confirmed unofficially that it was an improvised explosive device ( IED ) made of ammonium nitrate mixed in burnt charcoal which had massive upward impact and left a one-feet deep crater at the blast site.People heard the sound of the blast three km away . The intensity was such that the stone slabs were thrown up 10m in the air and those standing in a radius of 12 metres were sent flying . So far we have only collected broken pieces of a milk canister , a central intelligence official said rejecting additional DGP Brijlal 's assertion that it was a low-intensity blast.He also confirmed that two IEDs were recovered . Such a ` The Centre does n't give us sufficient forces ' trend has been seen in every terrorist attack committed by those who call their organisation the Indian Mujahideen . In fact failure of some bombs is seen as signature stamp of the IM , the official said.Trying to save his skin , Rajendra Pal Singh , Inspector General of Police denied that any more bomb was recovered and said the bomb disposal squad had done the sanitisation work at Dasashwamedh Ghat and LOC_Event at 5pm on Tuesday.This suggests that the bomb was planted in the cavity of the stair after 5pm . The rest is part of investigation for which we all are waiting , he added.POINT COUNTERPOINTUNION HOME MINISTER P. CHIDAMBARAMON HOLDING THE STATE RESPONSIBLEWe had cautioned all state governments that in the run up to 26/11 and 6/12 anniversaries , we can expect threats from terrorists . In fact , as far as UP is concerned , a specific advice was given on February 25 , 2010 that the Dashashwamedh Ghat was one of the targets . So this area had been identified as a possible target in February 2010 . I am not here to do a ` jugalbandi ' to blame anyone but specific advisories were given ... It is for the government of UP to realise that it is first the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order . Police and public order are state subjects.ON POLICE LAXITYI think the police made some arrangements ... There may have been some kind of laxity . I have always said there is no scope for relaxing the vigil . Unfortunately , despite the presence of the platoon , somebody was able to plant an IED in the LOC_Event . I think there is a lesson for the police.UP CABINET SECRETARY SHASHANK SHEKHAR SINGHON CENTRE HOLDING THE STATE RESPONSIBLEHolding state responsible is not justified . There was no specific actionable intelligence input regarding a terrorist act in Varanasi . An alert was received on February 25 this year , but that was up to Dusshera festival ( in October ) only . Expecting that input to be specific and actionable even after Dusshera festival is not justified ... Stating that the state was alerted in advance is far from reality.DENYING POLICE LAXITYAs a routine exercise , ghats where Ganga ` arti ' is held is sanitised at 5 pm every day and this exercise was carried out yesterday as well . Thus , there was no laxity yesterday.The chief minister is of the clear view that terrorism is a national problem and stringent action should be taken to tackle this . She is of the view that until and unless borders are secure it will not be possible to check acts of terrorism . . VARANASI : One more victim identified as Phoolwati -LRB- 50 -RRB- , seriously injured in the December 7 blast at Dashashwamedh Ghat and was admitted to the ICU of Sir Sunder Lal -LRB- SSL -RRB- Hospital , Banaras Hindu University , succumbed to her injuries on Saturday . With this , the death toll in Tuesday 's blast has gone up to two . Phoolwati , from Damoh district of Madhya Pradesh , had gone to the Ghat to attend the Ganga Aarti . She suffered serious head injuries in the blast and was rushed to the SSL Hospital . According to SSL chief medical officer Dr Kundan Kumar , she could not regain consciousness even after surgery and her condition deteriorated . ` She died on Saturday morning and her body was sent for postmortem , ' he said . The blast had also claimed the life of one-year-old Swastika Sharma . At least 37 people , including four foreigners , were injured . Talking to reporters , Phoolwati 's son Somnath Tiwari said his mother wanted to watch the Ganga Aarti on LOC_Event and had come to the city for the purpose . ` Hopefully , the ghats of the city would now witness strict security arrangements to check recurrence of such incidents , ' he said . Police said the blast in LOC_Event appeared to be a terrorist attack , but they would not say whom they suspected . . . The bomb was stashed in a milk container on the LOC_Event , one of many stone staircases leading to the Ganges river , the site of daily spiritual rituals , according to Brij Lal , a police official . . . The explosion set off a stampede , and 19 people , including four foreigners , were wounded , Lal said . It was not immediately clear how many were hurt in the blast and how many in the subsequent chaos . . . A 2-year-old who had been sitting on her mothers lap when the bomb went off died in a hospital , Lal said . Her mother and two others , including one of the foreigners , were in serious condition . . . The force of the explosion ripped away a metal railing and damaged stones up to 200 feet away , said a witness , Ramatama Srivastava . . . Srivastava who spoke by telephone from LOC_Event , which is about 180 miles southeast of the Uttar Pradesh state capital of Lucknow said he noticed the foreigners were watching the Hindu prayer ceremony and taking photographs . . . The ceremony is a daily ritual in LOC_Event , the holiest city in the Hindu religion , during which priests and others light oil lamps , ring bells , and chant prayers . . . The Press Trust of India reported a Muslim terror group allegedly claimed responsibility for the blast in an e-mail to several media outlets . . . . A day after the blast in LOC_Event 's Sheetla ghat killed a toddler and injured 37 others , the Mumbai Police said on Wednesday that Bhatkal brothers Riyaz and Iqbal the chiefs of the Indian Mujahideen had masterminded the explosion . . . The Bhatkal brothers are in Pakistan . . . Preliminary investigations have shown the actual muscle to carry on the blasts was provided by Dr Shahnawaz , the brother of IM foot soldier Mohammed Saif who was arrested in the Batla House encounter in September 19 , 2008 . . . In that encounter , a week after the Delhi blasts , the then IM commander Atiq Amin was killed and Saif arrested . . . Dr Shahnawaz , who is both in Dubai and Pakistan now , took charge thereafter . A Pakistan-trained mujahideen , Shahnawz is in regular touch with the Bhatkal brothers , sources said . . . He is also involved in the Delhi , Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts . . . It was widely expected that the IM terror modules that operated out of Azamgarh had been wiped out after the Batla encounter . But that is not so . . . Preliminary investigations point at IM members based in the Sanjarpur-Saraimeer-Phulpur area of the Azamgarh district , just 100 kilometres from Varanasi . . . Dr Shahnawaz along with aides Khalid , Abu Rashid and Bada Sajid or Mohammed Sajid had fled to Nepal after the Batla House encounter . This former physician in Lucknow Hospital is purportedly now in both Dubai and Pakistan . All four now hold Nepalese passports . . Meanwhile , the email in which the banned terrorist group , Indian Mujahideen , claimed responsibility for the bomb blast in LOC_Event originated from the suburb Vashi in Navi Mumbai . . . The email which was shot to several media houses minutes after the blast was sent through an unsecured WiFi connection of the Airtel broadband , official sources have said . . . The Indian Mujahideen module had hacked into a broadband Internet connection of a Navi Mumbai resident . . . ... contd . MUMBAI : Repeatedly hit over a half-a-dozen times since the early 1990s , India 's financial capital has now become the favourite hunting ground for terror outfits . Over 600 people have died in these attacks . The macabre dance of death has unnerved citizens amid fears that Mumbai may go the Karachi way . Pakistan 's port city , barely 800km from Mumbai , has been wracked with violence and bloodbath over the past few years . ' I am shocked beyond words . It proves yet again Mumbai 's un-preparedness . Civilians are not on the radar of politicians , who live safely in their havens , ' said industrialist Dilip De . ` It looks like a repeat telecast of the same incident . Politicians have already started the blame game and now the candle vigil marches will begin . The term security no longer has any meaning . It 's a shame , ' said filmmaker and activist Ashoke Pandit . Former Mumbai police commissioner M N Singh , who headed the investigations into the serial blasts of 1993 , said Mumbai will continue to be the prime target . ` Mumbai has been attacked every three years since 2003 . The city has a strong network of IM and SIMI . While the police upgraded its infrastructure and equipment after 26/11 attack , the focus should be on how to curb radicalization of youth from the minority community , ' he said . Singh warned that the reasons behind the first serial blasts in 1993 which was in revenge for the demolition of the Babri mosque still remained unresolved . ` It has not come to a closure because the prime instigators still elude the authorities . Their role was visible in subsequent attacks , ' he added . Former state chief secretary D M Sukhtankar said Mumbai 's being the financial nerve-centre makes it vulnerable to repeated attacks . ` The high population density , and its intense business and economic activity , make it an easy target for those who want to create worldwide panic , ' he said . ` Terrorists want to demonstrate that despite efforts to prevent such incidents they can still strike at will . Mumbai offers anonymity . It is difficult to identify someone next to you , ' he added . Former union home secretary Ram Pradhan , who headed the 26/11 probe committee , said Mumbai has always been a target because it is here that the maximum damage can be done . ` It 's a big city and such blasts hit the morale of the people , ' he said . India 's Western city of Mumbai was rocked by three serial blasts at around 7.30 pm on Wednesday . The explosions took place at LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . . At least 10 people were killed in the blasts , including four in Zaveri Bazaar . . . All three locations are busy market places and the evening rush hour added to the intensity of death toll which is feared to go up further . . . The blast at LOC_Event took place at Kabutar Khana bus stop in a car , while LOC_Event bomb was kept in a meter box at a LOC_Event . . . One unexploded bomb was also found in the city and the bomb squad has been rushed to the spot . . . Taking the toll of the situation National Investigative Agency ( NIA ) team has rushed to Mumbai from the national capital New Delhi and a high alert has also been declared in Mumbai . . . According to witnesses , at least 20 were injured in LOC_Event alone . . . Home Ministry has termed the blasts as terrorist attacks . . . . . . Three blasts rocked LOC_Event 's crowded LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event areas on Wednesday evening , killing 10 and injuringat least 100people . . . . . LOC_Event Police sources say the Indian Mujahideen is suspected to be behind the attack . In Delhi , Home Ministry sources too say that the hand of the IM working closely with the Lashkar-e-Tayiba is suspected.The first explosion took place at south LOC_Event 's LOC_Event , near the famous LOC_Event , in which scores were injured , said LOC_Event Police spokesperson Nisar Tamboli . . . . . The injured in this blast have been rushed to G T Hospital in LOC_Event area . . . . . The bustling market also has a number of jewellery shops . . . . . Akshay Doshi , a commuter , told rediff.com , ' I was at the traffic signal opposite LOC_Event . The blast was like nothing I have heard before . I saw many injured being carried away . ' . . . . Senior police officers including Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik , Additional Commissioner Naval Bajaj and Joint Commissioner Rajneesh Seth were present at the blast site . . . . . Also present were members of the Mumbai Anti-Terrorist Squad and a forensic team . . . . . . . The second explosion was reported in a car in central LOC_Event 's LOC_Event area . . . . . The vehicle parked near the LOC_Event bus stop was a private vehicle . The blast at LOC_Event , according to ACP Madhukar Sankhe , has taken place inside the meter box on the bus stop and the car was parked near it . The number of the grey car is MH-43 A 9384 . The entire bus stop has been reportedly blown up . . . . . ` We are verifying the nature of explosions . At this moment I can not say anything more than this , ' Tamboli said . . . . . A third blast was reported from LOC_Event in LOC_Event . The blast occurred outside a building named City Chamber . Ten people have died in the blast , claim reports . . . . . The critically injured have been taken to Harkishan Das Hospital at LOC_Event . . . . . Jayesh Labdi , a local diamond merchant , who claimed to have taken several inured to the hospital , said the blast occurred at peak hour . ` Most of the injured were hawkers , ' he said . . . . . The blast in LOC_Event has left jewellers in the area petrified . . . . . The limbs and legs of victims still are still scattered at blast site . This being an area where diamond traders do business , so there is a possibility of diamonds being scattered in the blast . Police have cordoned off the entire area.Ankit Jhaveri told rediff.com , ` At around 7.05 pm we were shaken up to hear the blasts . I have never heard such sound before . ' . . . . Vikram Balerao , a resident of LOC_Event , which is situated barely 30 metres from the blast site at LOC_Event was one of the few volunteers who took the injured to the nearest Saifee hospital . He said he saw many people without limbs and legs . . . . . Since there were no stretchers available immediately , they used tarpaulin sheets to ferry the injured to the hospital . Teams of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad and the National Investigative Agency have rushed to the spot . . . . . . . . MUMBAI : Chaos reigned in Opera House , the hub of LOC_Event 's diamond trade , as mediapersons and onlookers jostled to catch a view of the destruction wreaked by an improvised explosive device , which ripped through a crowded lane just outside Prasad Chambers and Panchratna Building , workplaces of 5,000-6 ,000 diamond merchants , brokers , cutters and polishers of precious stones . . . The police cordoned off the area which is packed with small eateries with a bomb squad collecting forensic evidence for clues into the type of explosive used . Most offices in the area were shut when the blast took place , five minutes before seven in the evening , as diamond traders normally leave for home at sundown . . . However , some who congregated to grab a bite at the roadside stalls were seriously injured by the blast impact , which brought down a heavy name board of a Jumbo Vada Pav stall that had earlier served as a police chowki . `` Information at first sight suggests 25-30 people have been seriously injured by the blast at LOC_Event , '' said Arup Patnaik , LOC_Event 's police commissioner , who was at the site shortly after the blast . . . `` Preliminary investigation indicates this could be the handiwork of a terrorist outfit though our investigation will ascertain who was responsible . Our effort will be to bring the guilty to book . A team from the National Security Guard is on its way and we have sounded a red alert across LOC_Event . '' . . However , the commissioner 's presence seemed to have done little to soothe the frayed nerves of those who witnessed the blast . `` Despite repeated warnings by a few traders , the business community chose to ignore the possibility of a bomb blast here , '' said Hardik Hundia , a diamond expert who heard the explosion from his office near Pancharatna . . . Asked whether the blast would compel diamond merchants to shift to the recentlyopened Bharat Diamond Bourse in the Bandra-Kurla Complex , Hundia said : `` There are around 5,000-6 ,000 traders here and only half a dozen have moved from here so far ... more than shifting out , the police should prevent illegal parking by twowheelers and diamond traders should push for setting up of a chowki here . '' . . Sanjay Kothari , vice-chairman of Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council , said though the blasts had created a psychosis of fear among businessmen , `` it would be business as usual tomorrow . We ca n't stop working ... if we do , we 'll be playing into the hands of terrorists responsible for this blast . '' . At 6.54 p.m. on July 13 , a bomb in a motorcycle tore into Mumbai 's 150-year-old LOC_Event , killing five people instantly . As pushcarts selling food were scattered and bodies lay mutilated , Hiten , a businessman , recounted how he carried the severed head of a victim to the nearby Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital . He tried , but could n't find the body parts.A minute later , at 6.55 p.m. , a tiffin box exploded , resounding through Prasad Chambers , Opera House , where diamond traders gather every evening to discuss the day 's business . The blast , which killed nine , left trader Chirag Vora shaken . It shattered the window panes . The diamonds on my tray were everywhere , he says.At 7.05 p.m. , yet another bomb went off , this time at LOC_Event at LOC_Event 's LOC_Event , where people shop for household goods . As injured people scrambled for cover amid splattered blood and damaged vehicles , Indulal Shah , who owns a sweet shop in the area , could only say : It took just a second . Everything changed . The usual chaos became a desperate panic.The serial blasts in LOC_Event left 18 people dead and over 100 injured . In this photo , policemen look for clues ar the LOC_Event blast siteIt is a deadly litany , all too familiar for a city of walking wounded . The city that never sleeps has become one that now sleeps in fear . The city of number-crunchers has now become a cold statistic . Twenty-one people were killed and 131 injured . Fourteen blasts in 18 years have exposed chinks that have now become embarrassingly routine . As have the platitudes . Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan made the startling discovery that the attacks proved terror groups are active and able to strike at will . Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram flew down to LOC_Event with South Mumbai MP and newly minted minister Milind Deora only to declare every city of India is still vulnerable to a coordinated attack by terrorists . Mumbai Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik , still to explain the cosy relationship between his officers and the city 's underworld dons , announced that some terror elements were involved in the attack.The timing and method used in the three blasts point to banned terrorist organisation Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , an offshoot of the Students Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) . Though the group became prominent in 2008 when it claimed responsibility for bomb blasts at Ahmedabad , Jaipur , Delhi and Assam , it has been active since 2003 . Safdar Nagori , a resident of Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh , is believed to be the architect of the IM . He launched the organisation for supposedly religious and academic purposes . Later , he became leader of the faction that opted for armed struggle . Now , Iqbal Bhatkal and his brother Riyaz run the organisation from Karachi , Pakistan.Injured at Zaveri Bazaar being taken to hospitalThe blasts took place two days after the city observed the fifth anniversary of seven blasts in local trains on July 11 , 2006 that killed 209 people , in which the IM was allegedly involved . A police officer points to the similarity between the timing and explosives in both the serial blasts . Ammonium nitrate was used in the train blasts and the blasts took place during 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. , he says . Chidambaram confirmed that ammonium nitrate was used in the July 13 blasts as well.Mumbai 's angry citizens , tired of having their resilience thrown at their faces and negotiating every day with fear , have had enough . They 've had enough of terror tourism . And they can do without any more salutes to their battered spirit . As Jignesh Shah , MD , Multi-Commodities Exchange , says , It 's time for every one , police , politician and the corporate , to devise a plan so we do n't have to see such horror pictures on television time and again . Why again Mumbai , why ? Its citizens want action . They want answers . They want to know why the police took half-anhour to arrive at Khau Gali in Zaveri Bazaar though the jewellery market has three police posts . They want to know why Mumbai Police had no warning of such an attack . And they want to know what the bosses-sitting in the Mumbai Police headquarters at Crawford Market , just 1 km away - have done to recommendations made after 156 died and 280 were injured in the 26/11 attacks.People help an injured woman at a bus stand in DadarThey want to know why the police continue to miss the plot . One of the key recommendations of the twomember Ram Pradhan Committee that went into the lapses of the 26/11 attacks was that the force should be radically transformed . Attacks will keep occurring until we professionalise our police forces , says a senior IPS officer . It makes me feel worse when you know the solution and are able to do nothing . Just a day before the strikes , the Mumbai Police were arguing in the Bombay High Court against handing the Jyotirmoy Dey investigation to the CBI.The blasts were a failure of predictive intelligence , the ability to tell where the next attack would come from . It calls for huge investments in human intelligence and trained manpower . A far cry in a state which has the largest number of vacancies - posts of 49,000 policemen are yet to be filled . The Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) in Maharashtra , formed in 2004 , has just 300 personnel despite a sanctioned strength of three times as many men . The police have failed to instil fear into the hearts of the bombers . They have been unable to maintain a constant presence to deter them , says Colonel M.P. Chaudhary ( retired ) , a former advisor to the city police.The blasts took the central agencies by surprise . There were no symptoms , no alerts , not a whiff that an attack was in the offing , a senior Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) official said in Delhi . It could well have been that the agencies were lulled into a sense of complacency . Since 26/11 , there has been just one significant attack , the February 13 , 2010 bombing of Pune 's LOC_Event which killed 17 persons and was traced to the IM . Analysts blamed the slump in attacks to Pakistan 's problems that seem to have kept it from fomenting terror attacks within India . One official admits that the IB 's Multi-Agency Centre - revitalised after 26/11 attacks for India 's 14 agencies to meet every day to pool information-had drifted into discussing virtual attacks in the cyberworld . The post-26 / 11 drift was everywhere . Key terrorism-related proposals like the National Intelligence Grid ran into fierce resistance at the Centre . The home ministry project that aimed at integrating existing databases like bank accounts and financial transactions to track terror suspects , got conditional approval only last month , 18 months after the project had been mooted.Prithviraj Chavan and P. Chidambaram address the media in MumbaiAdd to it Mumbai 's inherent vulnerability that makes it a soft target . A 468 sq-km linear city , it is less than a third the size of Delhi 's 1,483 sq km . But it is the country 's most densely packed metropolis . It has 29,042 people per sq km to Delhi 's 9,294 people per sq km , making policing difficult for its 60,000-strong force . Its local trains carry 69 lakh passengers every day , more than half of Indian Railways ' daily capacity , and are among the most crowded transport systems in the world . The buses in Mumbai carry 45 lakh passengers every day.Its coastline is open to attack , as 26/11 proved . Its water pipelines are susceptible to sabotage . The pipelines are surrounded by around 35,000 shanties and shockingly , the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) does not have a record of people staying there . Security experts have often warned that anti-social elements can break the water pipelines and contaminate the water . The Bombay High Court in 2009 had rapped the BMC for compromising citizens ' health by allowing slums around water pipes . The BMC started a demolition drive after that but could not clear the slums completely . Former IPS officer Y.P. Singh says , Mumbai is the perfect advertisement for any terrorist organisation that wants to make an impact . Seasonal downpours , which come in the way of effective policing , present the best opportunity.In such a situation of total paralysis , fear spreads fast . Paranoia is contagious , and in a multimedia age , it gets amplified quickly . Almost as soon as the blasts tore apart Mumbai , an SMS went viral in Delhi claiming bombs were discovered in Saket and Defence Colony . Someone spread the rumour that it was Ajmal Kasab 's birthday . Then someone else tweeted that the date was actually September 13 , and then corrected it yet again . A fourth bomb was found to be a bag with wires . Celebrities vented their anguish on twitter , ordinary citizens tried calling frantic families.At the ground floor lobby in Phoenix Mills , a popular mall in central Mumbai , a hush suddenly descended on shoppers making the best of discount season . As news of the blasts flashed on a TV screen , nearly everyone whipped out their phones to contact friends and family , only to find the network jammed . A young shopper voiced what the others were thinking . Damn . This city is getting really dangerous to live in.Especially certain areas . Terror has struck Zaveri Bazaar with frightening regularity . Known as much for its jewellery as its LOC_Event , it was first targeted on March 12 , 1993 , when a bomb was detected in the area . Later , it became clear that the bomb was part of the series that shook the city . On August 25 , 2003 , 36 people died in a powerful blast.Mumbai 's citizens are tired of such bad news and terrible memories . Ask Hemen Kapadia , a top stockbroker . He was in the BSE building in 1993 when the blasts happened . Every time he hears of another such explosion , it sends chills down his spine . He has just one question : Can someone tell me who is in charge here ? It 's a question whose answer needs to be given . Now.With inputs from T. Surendar , Shantanu Guha Ray and Bhavna Vij-Aurora . Mumbai : A man , who sustained serious injuries in the July 13 triple blasts here , today died in a city hospital , taking the death toll in the bombings to 19 . Babulal Das , 42 , who was admitted to Saifee Hospital after the blast at LOC_Event , died around 3 am , they said.Yesterday , Avinash Tamka -LRB- 23 -RRB- , who was admitted to the ICU in Bombay Hospital following the blast in LOC_Event , had died.Twenty people , who were seriously injured in the bombings , are being treated at various hospitals in the city.The triple blasts at LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event had left more than 130 people injured . . Mumbai : Three bomb blasts within twelve minutes during Mumbai 's rush hour have left at least 18 people dead and over 130 injured . Home Minister P Chidambaram , who reached Mumbai late at night , described the blast as `` a coordinated terror attack '' . Mr Chidambaram inspected all the three blast sites . -LRB- Read : Chidambaram on Mumbai blasts -RRB- Mumbai has been sealed and is on high-alert ; so are Delhi , Chennai , Kolkata and Bangalore . -LRB- Read : High alert in cities across India -RRB- The first blast took place at 6.56 pm in LOC_Event in South Mumbai , a crowded market named for the many small jewelry stores that fill its narrow streets . A minute later , there was an explosion at LOC_Event , also in South Mumbai ; the final strike was at 7.06 pm near LOC_Event at LOC_Event in Central Mumbai . The Home Minister said Improvised Explosive Devices -LRB- IED -RRB- were used in all three blasts . -LRB- Watch : YouTube videos on Mumbai blasts -RRB- Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan who described the blasts as `` an attack on the heart of India '' said the blast at LOC_Event was the most powerful . -LRB- Watch : This is an attack on the heart of India , says Maharashtra CM -RRB- This is Mumbai 's first terror attack after 26/11 in 2008 - when 166 people were killed in 72 hours by ten young men who sailed into the city from Karachi and attacked some of Mumbai 's most famous landmarks . The city wore a steely clam this evening . The Mumbai Police sent an SMS to all cellphone users in the city minutes after the blast , asking them to stay indoors . In 2008 , the police had been criticised for failing to share basic information with the city . -LRB- Read : Police 's SMS after Mumbai blasts -RRB- The Home Minister said that the National Security Guard -LRB- NSG -RRB- , which has a hub in Mumbai , was on standby . The National Investigation Agency or NIA has reached the site of the blasts and is working with the Mumbai Police to collect and analyse forensic evidence . A seven-member team from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory -LRB- CFSL -RRB- from Delhi is also in Mumbai . Sources have told NDTV that preliminary inspections by the forensic teams and bomb disposal squads have hinted at the use of ammonium nitrate in the IEDs . Traces of ammonium nitrate have been found at the blast sites , sources added.Heavy rain was pouring down over South Mumbai on Wednesday evening triggering fears that crucial evidence may be washed away . -LRB- Read : Concerns about evidence as rain lashes South Mumbai -RRB- Police sources say close circuit TV -LRB- CCTV -RRB- footage from security cameras opposite the bus stop at LOC_Event and at LOC_Event could provide them with leads in the post-blast investigations . The blasts were designed to disrupt the city when it is at its busiest . The LOC_Event blast took place in an umbrella kept at the crowded LOC_Event , a street of eateries where many commuters stop to snack before catching their local trains home . The LOC_Event explosion took place in a meter box on an electric pole near a bus stop . The LOC_Event blast took place at LOC_Event . `` I heard a loud explosion . And then I saw people with serious injuries lying in pools of blood , '' said an eyewitness to the LOC_Event explosion.Datatray Jadhav from LOC_Event said , `` A girl and another man were seriously injured . We put them both in a police van and sent them to the hospital .

MUMBAI : Prime minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi on Thursday arrived at Saifee hospital at 8.30 pm , along with chief minister Prithviraj Chavan , and went straight to the 6th floor , where victims of Wednesday 's serial blasts have been admitted , of which seven are in the ICU . Doctors appraised them of their condition and the entourage then went to the 5th floor , to meet other victims . They were at the hospital for 25 minutes . Eighteen victims are at Saifee , including a boy with an amputated leg . They later visited JJ Hospital too . Singh praised the state administration , saying it had risen remarkably well after the blasts . ` There has been a remarkable coordination of efforts . Now , the task is to find out who the culprits are and bring them to justice , ' Singh said , adding he had come to Mumbai to share the deep sorrow of the people . Earlier , Union home minister P Chidambaram stated that all cities were vulnerable to attacks and admitted that neither the Centre nor the state government had intelligence inputs about the serial blasts . However , he made it clear that having no prior inputs did not necessarily mean intelligence failure . The minister , who was addressing the media at the state government 's guest house , was accompanied by Chavan , deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , home minister R R Patil and key state officials . After visiting the blast sites , Chidambaram pointed out that ammonium nitrate was used in all three blasts . He stated that the blasts were well coordinated . ` Indians are living in troubled neighborhoods , as Pakistan and Afghanistan have become epicentres of terrorism . All cities are vulnerable , ' he added . Chidambaram observed that the blast near the Kabutarkhana at Dadar was low intensity , while those at Opera House and Zaveri Bazar were of medium to high intensity . ` Zaveri Bazar and Opera House have narrow bylanes with a high density of population . Even a low intensity blast would have a great impact ... this could be why the neighborhoods were chosen for the attack , ' he said . He also appreciated the resilience shown by all Mumbaikars . Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- leader L K Advani said that Pakistan was waging a proxy war against India through terror attacks , and added that there was no point in continuing dialogue with the neighbour until it dismantled terror camps on its soil . Advani , who arrived in Mumbai on Thursday morning , visited the blast sites as well as victims in various hospitals . The city , he said , had become a favourite target for terrorists , adding that the attacks were not an intelligence failure but the failure of government policy . Meanwhile , Rahul Gandhi 's remark that it was impossible to stop terrorist activities in the country has raised the hackles of the opposition Shiv Sena-BJP combine and the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena -LRB- MNS -RRB- . Chidambaram too earned the opposition 's ire for his statement that the blasts do not indicate intelligence failure . ` Gandhi 's statement smacks of gross insensitivity , ' Sena CEO Uddhav Thackeray said . He was talking informally to mediapersons after visiting KEM hospital , where he met victims . Sena chief Bal Thackeray condemned the Centre and the Maharashtra government for the ` dastardly ' attack on Mumbai , and urged Mumbaikars to arm themselves for protection in view of the apathy and indifference of those in power . MNS chief Raj Thackeray came down heavily on Gandhi for his ` foolish remark ' . ` Gandhi should remember that his father and grandmother died in terror attacks . Gandhi should have displayed sensitivity to those who died in the Mumbai blasts , ' said Raj . NEW DELHI : The security establishment was scrambling on Wednesday for any specific inputs that would give indications of who may have been behind the serial blasts that interrupted the past few months of lull from terror . Sources were veering around to the opinion that the likelihood of underworld involvement was very high because of a host of factors . One official pointed out that the underworld has been `` hyperactive '' in recent weeks in LOC_Event . There have been a number of reports about various developments in the underworld such as the killing of journalist J Dey and attacks on Dawood Ibrahim 's brother 's driver . Among the recent inputs is also the possibility of a patch-up between some factions . Another analyst speculated that the simultaneous blasts required a fairly good network in Mumbai as well as strong local support . He said it was likely that the blasts were executed by the underworld , financed by someone else . The attacks came just three days after the Centre issued a warning to LOC_Event , Hyderabad , Bangalore and Kolkata about the possibility of a Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami ( HuJI ) conspiracy to target these cities . However , sources are not willing to give much credence to this particular warning , which was based on inputs from BSF . BSF may have got its inputs from Bangladeshi sources . The security establishment was scrambling for any specific inputs that would give indications of who may have been behind the serial blasts . A third angle that is being closely looked at is the possibility of the involvement of Kashmiri terrorist groups . The blasts came on July 13 , which is observed as Kashmir Martyrs Day to commemorate the killing of 22 Kashmiris by the Dogra forces in 1931 . In the present phase of militancy that started in the late 1980s , Martyrs Day has been appropriated significantly by the separatists and terrorist groups . One top official said the degraded capabilities of Kashmiri militant groups in recent times defy the logic of them carrying out multiple blasts in LOC_Event . However , the official said possibility of Lashkar-e-Toiba ( LeT ) , which remains a very powerful terror group , carrying out the attack to coincide with July 13 can not be ruled out . Sources said they are seriously examining the possibility of Pakistan backed groups , especially the LeT , carrying out the attack to divert attention away from the domestic woes of Pakistan , and to warn that the Kashmir issue was far from over . If that were the case , then the Indian Mujahideen , or other LeT affiliates in Mumbai , may have been used for carrying out the attack , they said . . . . LOC_Event : Investigators on Saturday claimed they have obtained ` good leads ' in the triple explosions , ruled out involvement of a suicide bomber and said a suspect 's sketch may be prepared soon . Maharashtra ATS chief Rakesh Maria said investigations were moving in a ` certain direction ' but refused to elaborate . As investigators struggled for a breakthrough three days after the terror attack , police teams also fanned out to seven states widening the probe to get definite leads in a desperate hunt for the bombers . He said sketch of a probable suspect would be prepared soon based on certain eyewitness accounts and CCTV footage at a blast site . Maria also made it clear tht till the case is ` cracked ' and people involved are in the custody of the police they would not like to speculate which group was involved . He claimed the identification of persons seen in the CCTV footages was on and stated that photograph of an individual seen in the footage needed more verification . ` At this stage , I can say we have good leads and I am not in a position to reveal what the clues are . I can very confidently say , the investigations are probably moving in a certain direction , ' Maria said . ` After visiting the blast sites , we can now rule out the possibility of suicide bomber , ' the ATS chief added . Based on an eyewitness account , a sketch of a probable suspect may be ready by tonight and circulated among the investigators , Maria said . ` Experts have retrieved certain portions of metallic container which was used to store and carry the explosives , ' he added . Forensic experts had opined that ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil was used in the explosives while digital timers were used to carry out the blasts . He also said ammonium nitrate , crude oil and digital timers were used to trigger the explosions at the sites of three serial blasts . The death toll in the Wednesday attack rose to 19 after one of the victims of the blasts succumbed to his injuries in a city hospital . Teams of Maharashtra ATS and crime branch had gone to various places in Uttar Pradesh , Gujarat , Delhi , West Bengal , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Rajasthan Maria said , adding they were also taking the help of police of respective states and the central agencies . The ATS has questioned the owner of a scooter , which was found very close to the blast site in Zaveri Bazar here , to put together the sequence of events on July 13 . The maroon colour Honda Activa bearing number MH-01-AS 718 was one of the scooters which was very close to the blast site and was partially destroyed . The vehicle belongs to one Ashok Jain who lives in Nagpada area . ` Through the CCTV footage , we do have a photograph at one of the locations that needs more verification and investigations . Our teams are on the job to identify who that individual is , ' Maria said . The additional DG said Maharashtra ATS and the Crime branch teams questioned some previously arrested accused in MP in connection with the blasts . ` Our teams are fanned out at various places and -LRB- have -RRB- questioned a number of people having links with various modules arrested in the past in a bid to get leads in the case , ' Maria said while responding to another question . Nobody had been detained so far , he said . Asserting that the underworld angle , if any , will be examined , Maria said , 'Till the time we arrest the accused , it is inappropriate to say which group or outfit was involved in the blasts . ' When asked if any phone calls were received before the blasts and whether IB intercepted any calls after or before the explosions , the IPS officer said , ` There are calls received post blasts at various control rooms in the city and other controls rooms in and outside the state that had been verified except one call which needs to be verified . ' Elaborating on phone calls received in Buldana and Aurangabad , Maria said , ` There were calls after two blasts -LRB- informing -RRB- that third blast would take place veracity of which is being ascertained . ' The ATS has also sought assistance from Kolkata Police asking them to verify if any suspects had travelled to Mumbai from that city after the blasts . He said some of the CCTV footages were ` grainy ' and in a day or two , investigators will be able to get better images from the CCTV cameras recovered from the blast sites , he said . ' A police team from Karnataka has come to Mumbai to help us . An ATS team from Maharashtra will also go to Karnataka and Ahmedabad to question the IM members lodged in the jails there , ' said a police official . LOC_Event : A hazy picture is gradually emerging of how the blasts took place - sophisticated Improvised Explosive Devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- were used ; they were triggered by alarms set on cellphones . No sim cards have been found at the locations of the blasts . Two of the bombs used over a kilo of explosives . `` Preliminary investigations indicate the use of IEDs with ammonium nitrate-based explosives . The IEDs are not crude . They indicate some level of sophistication , '' Union Home Secretary RK Singh told reporters on Thursday , a day after triple blasts in LOC_Event left 17 people dead , 131 injured and a severed head to be identified.Mr Singh also confirmed that a dead body at JJ Hospital in LOC_Event had been found with an electrical circuit on it . When asked if the gadget could have been a timer used to trigger one of the explosions , he said that it was safest for now to assume that the person who died was standing close to where an explosion took place . UK Bansal , Special Secretary for Internal Security said there were no leads yet against any terror group.Meanwhile , Mumbai Police now say the CCTV footage from LOC_Event and LOC_Event Bazaar blasts sites has yielded little . They now hope to find some vital clues in the footage from a building near the LOC_Event , the third blast site.Investigations are being carried out by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- and the Mumbai Police -LRB- Crime Branch -RRB- , assisted by teams from the National Investigating Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- , the National Security Guard -LRB- NSG -RRB- and Central Forensic Science Laboratory -LRB- CFSL -RRB- . The NIA Director General is in LOC_Event to oversee the probe.The union Home Ministry has been updating the media regularly about post-blast investigations . Home Minister P Chidambaram , who is in LOC_Event , refused to speculate on who is responsible for the attacks . He said no group has so far claimed responsibility . He added that all groups `` hostile to India '' were being probed . `` We have asked the police and investigators not to proceed on presupposition . All those who have the capacity to carry out terror attacks are suspected . All angles will be investigated , all premises will be examined , all leads will be followed , '' Mr Chidambaram said . -LRB- Watch : Live video of our complete coverage -RRB- . The investigation into the 13/7 triple bombings has revealed that the two Pakistani bombers staying in Byculla 's Habib Apartments used as many as 18 SIM cards and six handsets . The revelation has sent alarm bells ringing in the force . Cops are particularly worried since a survey conducted by them last year had found that four out of 10 SIM cards in use in Mumbai were procured with forged documents , which can be gained for a paltry Rs 5 . Police sources from the Kalachowkie unit of the Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- told TOI that two suspected 13/7 bomberswho have been identified in court documents as ` A ' and ` B ' , but are believed to be Pakistanis named Waqqas and Tabrezwere provided 18 SIM cards by co-accused Naqi Ahmed . Naqi was first arrested by the ATS in January this year for possessing SIM cards obtained with fake documents . It was during his interrogation in this case that Naqi admitted his role in the July 13 blasts and explained the conspiracy . He also admitted working with Indian Mujahideen 's founder member Yasin Bhatkal to arrange accommodation for the bombers at Habib Apartments . ` We suspected that the bombers changed SIM cards to avoid telephonic surveillance during their stay in Mumbai . We are still collecting the call records of these SIM cards , ' a police officer said on condition of anonymity . The officer explained that a relative of Naqi ran a shop in Madanpura where he sold SIM cards . The cards for the Pakistani bombers were acquired from there after furnishing fake documents . The cards were however never used to make calls to Pakistan . Nor were any calls received on them from Pakistan . ` We are trying to find out if any other SIM was used to speak to family members or handlers in Pakistan , ' the officer said . The bombers also changed six mobile handsets to avoid leaving behind a trail of evidence . The money for the handsets was provided to Naqi by his handlers in Bihar , said a source . The revelation is a security fear come true for the police . Last year , they had found in a survey that about 40 % of the SIM cards in use in Mumbai were procured with forged documents . A subsequent investigation showed that a set of fake documentsincluding a colour photograph , a ration card and a photo identity cardrequired for obtaining a SIM card can be bought in several areas of Mumbai for as little as Rs 5 . For the survey , the police examined documents submitted for 26,450 randomly chosen SIM cards . Out of these , more than 10,000 were found to be forged . Shaken by the findings , the ATS has written to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India -LRB- TRAI -RRB- , asking for stricter implementation of norms related to verification of documents submitted for getting SIM cards . ` While investigating serious offences , including terror attacks , we found that the accused had used SIM cards issued on bogus documents , ' said a senior ATS officer . ` We have requested TRAI to ensure stricter implementation of norms since this is a matter of national security . ' After the 13/7 blasts , the Bhiwandi police had arrested a man and seized more than 1 lakh SIM cards , all of which had been issued using fake identity documents . The police later said the accused had been selling cards to telephone booth owners , who earned lakhs using these cards . There was , however , no record of the users . Nearly a year after triple bomb blasts shook the city killing 27 people and wounding many others , Maharashtra ATS today filed 4700-page charge sheet in a special court against 10 members of Indian Mujahideen , including its top operative Riyaz Bhatkal , believed to be hiding in Pakistan . . . Of the 10 members of the home terror group , six are absconding while four have been arrested . Those facing trial are Naquee Ahmed , Nadeem Shaikh , Kanwar Pathrija and Haroon Naik . . .

In an another development , ATS claimed to have arrested one more accused in the 13/7 blast case , Mohammed Qafeel Ansari ( 55 ) , who was already in the custody of Delhi Police in a terror-related case . . . Ansari , hailing from Darbanga in Bihar , was arrested in Mumbai blasts case on May 19 , taking the total number of arrests to five , Maria said , adding his transit remand was sought and a supplementary charge sheet would be filed soon . . . Ansari was involved in criminal conspiracy and also provided logistical support in executing the crime , ATS officials said . . . `` Riyaz , who is suspected to be in Pakistan now , was in coordination with absconding Yasin , who looks after the IM 's operations in India , had conspired and executed the blasts at business hubs with an intention to destroy economic structure ( of the city ) , '' Maria said . . . . President Pratibha Patil and Vice President Hamid Ansari on Wednesday condemned the terror attacks in LOC_Event .

Ansari expressed deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the attacks . Meanwhile , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke with Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and asked him to keep the prime minister 's office posted on the developments . . . . . Singh also spoke with Home Minister P Chidambaram and asked him to do everything needful in the matter . Bharatiya Janata Party veteran L K Advani also spoke with Chidambaram to seek an update on the developments . . . . . The BJP strongly condemned the attack in LOC_Event and asked the government to take a determined stand to deal with the menace . Congress President Sonia Gandhi condemned the dastardly act of terror in Mumbai and expressed sympathy to the affected families and appealed to people to remain vigilant and united against these elements , an All India Congress Committee statement said . . . . . . . Condemning the LOC_Event blasts in the strongest possible terms , BJP President Nitin Gadkari asked the government to take a clear stand in setting up an effective anti-terror infrastructure . . . . . ` No word can ably express the anguish over these dastardly attacks . We condemn them in the strongest possible words , ' Gadkari said in a statement . . . . . ` We hope the government will move beyond reacting from one blast to another and take a clear stand on issues like effective deterrence infrastructure , ' he said . . . . . Gadkari said the blasts were a reminder of the fact that cases like Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru continue to wait for final action and government dithers from not talking to Pakistan . . . . . Three serial blasts rocked crowded areas of LOC_Event this evening killing at least 13 people and injuring about a hundred . . US President Barack Obama has offered US help in bringing the perpetrators of the LOC_Event blasts to justice . `` India is a close friend and partner of the United States .

It is disturbing that the forces behind the recent bomb blasts in different parts of the country have not been identified and apprehended . No efforts should be spared to track down the culprits of the LOC_Event blasts , the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- Polit Bureau said in a statement in New Delhi . . . In the same vein , the Communist Party of India Central Secretariat said this was not the first time that such blasts have taken place . This is clear evidence that the government is unable to trace the perpetrators through its intelligence agencies . Therefore the Centre should take appropriate measures to track down the terrorists . . . Senior CPI leader D. Raja , who visited a blast site and hospitals in LOC_Event on Wednesday night , accused Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram of continuously failing at maintaining peace . . . Observing that Mr. Chidambaram was resorting to rhetoric than action , he said though the internal security issue has been debated many times in Parliament , no decision to strengthen the security apparatus seems to have been implemented . Security agencies might have slackened their alertness . If lapses are found , action should be taken to plug the loopholes . . . Mr. Raja also criticised Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi for his reported statement that 99 per cent of terror attacks have been thwarted . . . Such casual and callous remarks should not be made . One should be more serious while commenting on such sensitive incidents , he said , adding that Mr. Gandhis comments on the U.S. and Afghanistan raises questions as to whether he knows what he is talking about . LOC_Event : The government should find out those behind this evening 's serial blasts in LOC_Event , the Shiv Sena said . `` There is chaos everywhere . This must be a terrorist act as it happened in three places , '' senior Sena leader Manohar Joshi said after reaching LOC_Event , one of the three sites of the blasts . `` I want that the government take immediate steps and find out who are people behind the blasts , '' Joshi said.Lyricist Javed Akhtar said `` No words are strong enough to condemn the attacks . `` This menace called terrorism ... something has to be done . Something drastic . This is not acceptable , '' he said.Explosions have been reported in LOC_Event 's LOC_Event , LOC_Event in LOC_Event , and LOC_Event in LOC_Event Road . . Shiv Sena today said it was wrong for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to equate LOC_Event terror attacks with those in Afghanistan . . . `` We elect you to protect us . When you compare the LOC_Event attacks to those in Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan . It is an insult to those killed in these attacks , '' Sena MP Sanjay Raut said . . . A case of treason should be filed against Rahul Gandhi over these remarks , he said . . . `` Rahul does not leave a single chance to insult LOC_Event . When he says the terror attacks will continue to happen , it shows that he is not fit to live in LOC_Event , '' Raut said . . . Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi today said that 99 per cent of the terror attacks had been stopped in the country due to improved intelligence , but admitted that it 's difficult to stop all terrorist attacks . . . `` We will stop 99 per cent attacks . But in one per cent they will get through . . It is something we will fight and we will defeat , '' he told reporters at Bhubaneswar this morning on the second day of his 2-day tour to Orissa . . . To a question how US was able to stop any terrorist attacks on its soil , Rahul said the US soldiers were taking the hit in foreign shores like Afghanistan and Iraq . . . Referring to Wednesday 's attack , Gandhi said the response of the government was prompt . `` We are responding to it in a quite organised fashion . '' . Chairman of moderate Hurriyat faction Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Thursday condemned the Mumbai serial blasts saying such incidents are orchestrated to derail the dialogue process between India and Pakistan . . . `` We are saddened by the huge loss of life in the LOC_Event blasts and condemn it . Spilling the blood of innocents ? be it in LOC_Event , Palestine , Karachi or Kashmir ? is a shameful and inhuman act , '' the Mirwaiz said in a statement . United Nations : United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- chief Ban Ki-moon has strongly condemned the serial bomb blasts that rocked India 's LOC_Event of LOC_Event , killing at least 18 people and injuring over 130 . `` The Secretary-General -LRB- Ban -RRB- condemns the attacks that have killed and injured many in LOC_Event , '' said a statement from his office . `` No cause or grievance can justify indiscriminate violence against civilians . The Secretary-General expresses his solidarity with the Government and people of India , and extends his sincere condolences to the families of the victims , '' it added.The UN Security Council also `` condemned in the strongest terms '' the bombings.They expressed their deep sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims of these `` heinous acts '' and to their families , and to the people and Government of India . `` The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security , and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable , regardless of their motivation , '' a statement read by Peter Wittig , Germany 's ambassador to the UN and current Council president , said.Terror struck LOC_Event last evening when three near-simultaneous blasts ripped through crowded areas in the city . At least 18 people were killed and over 130 injured . . A special NIA court on Tuesday ordered that terror and murder charges be framed against Delhi High Court blast accused Wasim Akram Malik . However , the court said that the offence of waging war against India was not made out against Malik by the NIA . The blast outside the Delhi High Court on September 7 last year killed 15 people and left scores of persons injured . . . The court ordered framing of criminal conspiracy , murder , attempt to murder , and voluntarily causing grievous hurt charges against Malik under the Indian Penal Code . Charges under various sections of the Explosive Substance Act and the Unlawful Activities -LRB- Prevention -RRB- Act were also ordered to be framed against the accused . . . On the charge of waging war against the country , Special Judge H. S. Sharma said : These offences -LRB- relating to waging war against country -RRB- require something more than the one which is available against the accused in this case . Merely because a bomb had exploded outside the Delhi High Court and in the e-mail , there was a reference of release of Afzal Guru , it does not mean that these three offences are made out . . . The three sections of the IPC 121-A , 122 , 123 of IPC relate to waging war against the country . The evidence , even at the stage of framing of charges under these sections has to be clear and commensurate with the requirement of these sections , Mr. Sharma said . . . One of the accused in the case , Amir Abbas Dev , had turned approver and was granted pardon by the judge . His statement recorded under Sector 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code has material that apparently indicts Malik . Dev is currently lodged in judicial custody . . . The statements of prosecution witnesses who said that Malik was in LOC_Event on June 29 to conduct reconnaissance in areas including the High Court was relied on by the court to state that there was prima facie evidence against the accused . . . Formal framing of charges against Malik is slated for September 18 . The court also said it was deliberately refraining from discussing the evidence in detail at this stage of proceedings . . . It is well settled that at the time of framing of charges , no rowing inquiry is to be made . The court is required to take into account the evidence collected during the investigation . The evidence is not required to be meticulously examined , Mr. Sharma said . The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Friday claimed to have arrested the key conspirator of September 's blast at the Delhi High Court . The NIA arrested Wasim , an Indian medical student based in Bangladesh.Sources told Headlines Today that Wasim is studying medicine in Bangladesh . He and four others allegedly hatched the plot in Bangladesh and took the help of his local contacts in Kishtwar , Jammu and Kashmir to carry out the attack.The NIA is working on the theory that Wasim was lured by the Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami in Bangladesh and his network in Jammu and Kashmir was used to send the e-mail claiming responsibility for the blast . NIA officials claimed that with Wasim 's arrest , they are on track to unearthing the conspiracy behind the blast and the plotters . Wasim 's arrest is the third in the Delhi High Court blast case . The NIA had earlier arrested Aamir Abbas and Abid Hussain , both residents of Kishtwar . Abid was arrested for sending the terror e-mail after the blast . The NIA was able to reach Wasim following the interrogation of Abbas.The September 13 bomb blast outside LOC_Event of the Delhi High Court left 15 people dead and over 70 injured . . AHMEDABAD : A 22-year-old data entry operator working in a town 120km from LOC_Event on Monday learnt the hard way that being funny about terror does n't pay . Monu Ojha , an internet addict from Patan , was arrested by Gujarat police after they traced a mail , threatening that the next blast would take place in LOC_Event , to his computer . But even after his arrest , the youth was unrepentant . He said he did it to alarm Gujarat cops so that security was stepped up in Ahmedabad where his family lived . Monu Ojha , the 22-year-old school dropout , who is behind the Delhi terror email , has been charged with cyber terrorism and if convicted faces life imprisonment or a jail term of 14 years . ' I do n't believe the police are equipped to fight terror and I am happy that the mail has generated so much action . I am half-guilty that it created trouble for citizens , ' he said . He admitted he expected to be famous after his act . Ojha 's mail was the third of the four that claimed responsibility for the blast and threatened more attacks . ` The breakthrough came when cyber cell tracked the email down to a server in Russia and found it to be a decoy , ' said Ahmedabad police commissioner Sudhir Sinha . A probe found that the IP address was masked by specialized software . Using cyber crime probe tools , the crime branch tracked down the computer used to send the mail to Patan . The officers then hunted down the address and detained Rajkumar Yadav , from UP . When Yadav was questioned , he directed them to his friend Monu Ojha , who confessed to sending the mail using Yadav 's laptop . TIMES VIEW : Hoax calls or mails might seem like innocent pranks to be dealt with indulgently , but that would be a completely wrong attitude to take in the times we live in . These hoax mails/calls do serious damage at several levels , each of them helping the terrorists , even if that is not the intention . For one , they add to the panic , which is precisely the purpose of terror . Secondly , they divert already overstretched police resources to investigating the hoax calls . Finally , there is the serious risk that if there are many hoax threats , the genuine ones too will be taken lightly . For all of these reasons , such hoax callers must be dealt with strictly . At the same time , the police must launch an awareness campaign to educate people on the damage such calls or mail can do . Investigators probing the LOC_Event high court blast have zeroed in on a Patna-based man and have launched a hunt to nab the owner of a car which is suspected to have ferried the perpetrators . . . ` The car 's owner has cheated a few people and they have told the investigators that the face of the car owner resembles the sketch of a suspect released last evening , ' official sources said on Thursday . . . The car has been traced to neighbouring Faridabad , nand efforts were on to trace the owner of the vehicle , they said . . . ` Another man from Patna who was arrested on charges of using a stolen ATM card is being interrogated by the joint team led by National Investigation Agency , ' they said . Twelve people have died and 75 injured in the powerful blast that took place outside gate number 5 of the court on Wednesday . . . Meanwhile , Delhi police and NIA teams met Delhi high court Chief Justice Dipak Misra and discussed with him measures to beef up security in and around court premises and installation of CCTV cameras , metal-detectors and other security gadgets . . . The sources said the government has also decided to hand over to NIA the case relating to the May 25 low-intensity blast outside the Delhi high court . . A day after the deadly attack outside the Delhi High Court , investigators have traced the Harkat-ul - Jehadi Islami email claiming responsibility for the blast to Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir . . . There are only two cyber cafes in the district . National Investigation Agency officials are questioning two owners of a cyber cafe , Mohammed and Khalid Aziz . . . ` We are investigating the email link from Kishtwar district in connection with the LOC_Event blast , ' Director General of police Kuldeep Khoda said . . . There is an input about an email being sent from Kishtwar district , he said , adding police is working on it . Khoda said no arrests have been made so far . According to police sources , the email was sent from a cyber cafe in Kishtwar from the address arkatuljihadi2011@gmail.com . . . Even as the questioning with the cyber cafe owners is underway , suspicion points towards a young boy aged around 18 years having sent the mail . Initial reports suggest that the draft was prepared as early as 7.30 am . . . ` We own responsibility of the blast at the high court , LOC_Event . Our demand is that Afzal Guru 's death sentence should be repealed immediately as we would target major High Courts and the Supreme Court of India , ' the HuJI email said . . . Secretary -LRB- Internal Secretary -RRB- in the Home Ministry , U K Bansal had said yesterday that the National Investigation Agency is also verifying the authenticity of the email received by two media channels . . . Asked about the communication received by TV channels , Director General of NIA S C Sinha had said , ` It is too premature to comment on the HuJI mail but we are looking at it seriously because HuJI is a very prominent terrorist group which considers India as target number one . ' . . Delhi Police has in the past arrested several HuJI militants from the national capital . . . Meanwhile , the NIA team is also likely to take over the investigations of the May 25 blast outside the Delhi high court as well . . . Investigators are looking at the possibility of both the high court blast being linked with the same group as traces of PETN have been established the composition of explosives used in both the blasts . . . While officials have not yet zeroed in on any particular group , the presence of PETN , has strengthened the possibility of HuJi 's involvement , since PETN is the ` explosive of choice ' for Jehadi groups such as the HUJI . . . The preliminary report that was handed over to the Home Ministry officials states that the crater was about 2 feet wide and one foot deep . . . The report says that the maximum damage was caused because of the explosion and not shrapnel . So far , forensic teams have not been able trace any wire or timer device . . . National Security Guard officials believe that a battery could have triggered the blast . They also inform that since PETN has a tendency of evaporating , only a few samples have been found from the location , but enough to strongly indicate the presence of the explosive . . . The briefcase in which explosive was placed is estimated to be of 48 cm in length , 30cm wide , and 15 cm in thickness . . . With inputs from PTI . Investigations into terror attacks have made little headway since terror groups prefer to keep their identity concealed after an attack , saysVicky Nanjappa . . . . . Wednesday 's high court blast in LOC_Event has left investigating agencies in a state of confusion . A mail that was sent out earlier in the day is the only lead that investigators have . However , there is still suspicion regarding the authenticity of the mail.A 20-member team of the National Investigating Agency has already begun its probe . The team now awaits the results from the Forensic Sciences Laboratory , which is examining the bomb composition . . . . . Although the composition will be known in a couple of days , it may not really help the agency zero down on any particular outfit . . . A couple of years back terror groups had a signature style of attack . The bombs assembled during the twin blasts in Hyderabad gave vital leads to the police since the bomb that was assembled bore a signature . Intelligence Bureau officials say that each terror group had a signature styled bomb , which made it easier to track the outfit . The Students Islamic Movement of India , Indian Mujahideen , Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islamiall had their own style of packaging and also planting a bomb . . . However , today , that has changed . Terror groups have become extremely careful not to reveal their identity when an attack has been carried out . Earlier , terror groups wanted their identity to be known since it was a matter of pride for them . However , the terror scenario has changed a great deal and terror groups prefer to keep their identity concealed . . . This change has basically made investigation a nightmare for the police . Blast cases will not be easy to investigate in the days to come . It has become a cat and mouse game between terror groups and the police and the latter are sure going to find it very difficult to crack these cases . . . . . A police officer pointed out that nowadays with each blast the investigations need to start from scratch unlike the past where they could rely heavily on information obtained from earlier blasts . . . . . The blasts earlier had a connection and all the police needed to do was to join the dots . Moreover , when the Indian Mujahideen carried out blasts , they also gave the police the privilege of a full-fledged mail that gave the first lead . Now , this too is missing and terror groups have become smarter and try their best to conceal their identity as much as possible . . . Police sources say that they will have to rely much more on human intelligence in the days to come . These blasts that are taking place may not be undertaken by full-fledged terror groups and could be the handiwork of one or two people . This would mean that the police will have go back and rely on age-old tactics to crack the case . This means they will have to activate their sources on the ground -LRB- anti-social elements -RRB- and seek information from them . . . . . They will also have to rely heavily on statements given by those people present before the blast to find out if they saw anything suspicious . . . . . Each of the latest incidents of terror would need to be treated as a fresh case and the investigations need to be independent in nature . There is no point in relying on signatures and also information from previous blasts . One thing is clear that none of these blasts in the past two years are inter-connected . . Zeenews Bureau . . New Delhi : Even as the investigating agencies grope in the dark about crucial leads pertaining to Delhi High Court blast , Pakistans links to the incident have come to fore on Wednesday . . . As per reports , a Noida-based boy , identified as Neeraj , had received a phone call from an unknown caller from Pakistan on August 17 suggesting that a blast was imminent in LOC_Event in the near future . . . The caller didnt divulge more details about his location but stressed that vital installations in LOC_Event would be blown at a chosen time . . . The boy , who lives in Bhangel area of Noida , immediately passed this information to the Noida Police Control , which later passed it to its superior officers and Delhi Police . . . The boy himself tried to verify the veracity of the phone call ( number 923453367472 ) , which was later traced to a military camp located in Islamabad . This was confirmed by Anant Dev , SP City Noida , who said , A boy identified as Neeraj received a phone call from an unknown location about a possible bomb blast in LOC_Event . The boy claimed that the call was made from Pakistan . We had passed this information to concerned officers for further verification . . . Unfortunately , no deliberate attempts were made on the part of the investigating agencies to verify the authenticity of the phone call and the matter was pushed to the back burner . . . However , with the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami ( HuJI ) claiming responsibility for todays blast , the needle of suspicion has once again turned to the neighbouring country . Lending credence to the involvement of Pakistan-based elements , HuJI today sent an email claiming responsibility for the blast outside Delhi High Court this morning . . . We own the responsibility for today ` s blasts at Delhi High Court . Our demand is that Mohammed Afzal Guru ` s death sentence should be repealed immediately else we would target major High Courts and the Supreme Court of India , ' the email sent by HuJI said . . . A 20-member team led by the National Investigations Agency ( NIA ) is examining the email sent by HuJI . . . Reacting to HuJIs e-mail , NIA chief SK Sinha said the mail sent is being looked at since HuJI was involved in the Mumbai blasts too . . . HuJI ` s hand is suspected in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack at Chabad House in Colaba . . . At least eleven people were killed and over sixty others injured when a high-intensity blast went off outside the Gate number 5 of the Delhi High Court . LOC_Event : The government is investigating an email allegedly sent by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami -LRB- HuJI -RRB- claiming responsibility for the blast at the Delhi high court that killed at least 12 people and injured 62 others on Wednesday , a senior security official said . HuJI , in an email sent to the media , wrote , ` We own the responsibility for today 's blasts at Delhi high court . Our demand is that Mohammed Afzal Guru 's death sentence should be repealed immediately else we would target major high courts and the Supreme Court of India . ' National Investigation Agency chief SC Sinha told reporters it was premature to comment on the veracity of the HuJI email . He , however , added that he was taking the contents of the email seriously as HuJI is a major terror outfit . Afzal Guru was given the death sentence by the Supreme Court in 2004 for his role in the attack on Parliament in 2001 . New Delhi : A bomb placed in a briefcase exploded at the Delhi High Court this morning killing 11 people and injuring over 70 . The explosion took place in the reception area at LOC_Event , where hundreds of people had gathered to collect passes needed to enter the courthouse . The bomb was so powerful that it drove a huge crater into the ground.The Delhi Police has released two sketches of the man believed to be responsible for today 's terror attack , based on descriptions provided by eyewitnesses . -LRB- See sketches of the suspect -RRB- . By the evening , a special team of 20 members of the National Investigating Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- that is handling the case was trying to verify the authenticity of an email received by NDTV and another media house , purportedly from the Harkat-ul-Jihadi -LRB- HuJI -RRB- , claiming responsibility for the blast.Today 's explosion took place at 10.15 am - `` rush hour '' for the courthouse which usually starts hearings at 10.30 am . -LRB- Watch -RRB- On Wednesday , Public Interest Litigations -LRB- PIL -RRB- are heard in the High Court , drawing larger than usual crowds . In the seconds after the blast , lawyers and litigants were seen running for help , their blood-soaked clothes clinging to them . `` I heard a loud noise and smoke coming out following by cries of people , '' said Narendra Kumar Singh , a guard at a construction site outside the court.Two kilos of explosives were used in the bomb , said UK Bansal , Special Secretary in the Home Ministry , adding that ammonium nitrate was used ; so was high-grade PETN which is an extremely powerful explosive which can cause considerable damaged even if used in small quantities . -LRB- Read : What is PETN ; why is it deadly ? -RRB- This is the second explosion in the Delhi High Court in four months . A smaller bomb in a parking lot in May did not cause any injuries . Police sources say that attempt may have served as a dry run by the terrorists behind today 's attack . The incident in May had underscored the need for security cameras . They have yet to be installed at the court 's nine different gates . -LRB- First pics of the blast -RRB- The police said the proposal to install security cameras was stuck with court officials . But the head of the Delhi Bar Association , Rakesh Tiku , said `` The High Court has even written to Delhi Police for installation of CCTV cameras at all gates . '' Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said , `` We will have to wait for the investigation to tell us exactly who is at fault over the CCTVs . '' Two hours after the blast , Home Minister P Chidambaram addressed Parliament and revealed that `` Intelligence pertaining to threats emanating from certain groups was shared with Delhi Police in July , 2011 . '' He also said that it is not possible at this stage to identify who is responsible for today 's terror attack . The National Investigating Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- will supervise the inquiry with a special 20-member team . -LRB- Watch : Not yet possible to identify who 's behind blast , says Chidambaram -RRB- Delhi 's Lieutenant Governor Tejinder Khanna said that the intelligence shared with the police was `` not actionable . '' -LRB- Watch : Delhi 's Lt Governor to NDTV -RRB- An email received by different media organisations including NDTV said that the Harkat-ul-Jihadi -LRB- HuJI -RRB- takes responsibility for today 's blast . HuJI is a Pakistan-based terrorist group . `` HUJI is a lethal group ... we take the mail very seriously , '' said NIA Chief SC Sinha . The email states , `` We owe the responsibility of today 's blasts at High Court Delhi ... our demand is that Afzal Guru 's death sentence should be repealed immediately else we would target major high courts and the Supreme Court of India . `` Afzal Guru has been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court for his role in the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 . His mercy petition that asks for his sentence to be commuted to life is pending with President Pratibha Patil . The Home Ministry has reportedly recommended that it be rejected.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , currently in Bangladesh on an official visit , described the attack as `` a cowardly act of a terrorist nature . '' He added , `` We will deal with it ... we will never succumb to the pressure of terrorism ... this is a long war . '' -LRB- Read -RRB- The Opposition BJP said the war against terror needs a combined front across party lines , but was severe in its indictment of the government . Sushma Swaraj who visited the High Court said the government 's lethargy had been exposed by the fact that the High Court has been attacked twice - and there are still no security cameras . Arun Jaitley said `` Not generating intelligence is failure of intelligence . '' There was no shortage of political stopovers at the court . Mr Chidambaram visited the site of the blast ; so did Ms Swaraj , senior BJP leader LK Advani and the Congress ' Rahul Gandhi , who had been heckled when he visited Ram Manohar Lohia hospital where some of those injured are being treated . While Parliament was adjourned for the day , by 2 pm , the High Court was back to work to signal that it remains strong despite today 's attack . -LRB- Watch : Crowd heckles Rahul Gandhi outside hospital -RRB- But the conversations in and outside court-rooms were about the tragedy . Lawyer Sanjeev Beniwal rushed his client Mehtab Singh to a Delhi hospital after the explosion . Mr Singh did not survive . `` He -LRB- Singh -RRB- was fighting a property-related case at the court . He was getting his pass made when the blast occurred . His son Rohit and my associate Sachin Powa have also been injured . We rushed them to hospital and I just want them to be safe as I could not save Singh , '' said Mr Beniwal , who was also injured.The government will find itself struggling to provide an explanation for why terror continues to stalk cities with relative ease . On July 13 , also a Wednesday , three bombs exploded in crowded markets in LOC_Event during rush hour . More than 20 people were killed . -LRB- Watch : Delhi High Court blast - Eyewitness account -RRB- Here are the emergency helpline numbers : RML hospital : 011-23348200 , 23404446 , 23743769 , 23404478AIIMS : 011-26588700Safdarjung Hospital Helpline : 011 - 26707444 . It was on a Wednesday less than two months ago that serial blasts shook Indias financial capital of Mumbai . And it was on Wednesday of this week , with the memories of that July 13 attack still fresh in the national psyche , that a deadly blast shook Indias national capital of Delhi , rattling not only the citys High Court , but also the confidence of a nation trying hard to fight the menace of terrorism . . . I reached the blast site within half an hour of the incident , and what I saw was complete chaos . Most of the injured and dead had been removed by that time , but some victims were still being hastily placed into ambulances while the police were cordoning off the area . . . The gate where the tragic incident took place is the main entry point for litigants seeking passes to enter the court premises , and its generally very crowded in the morning . At 10:17 am , when the bomb went off , there were around 100 people in the area , according to an eyewitness to whom I spoke . One of the lawyers informed me that since Wednesday is designated for hearing public interest cases , its always a busy day at the court . . . A lawyer , Gajendra Gupta , whose white shirt was stained with blood , told me the blast had taken place just as he was entering the building and that he had helped place the victims into the ambulances . It was a deafening noise and by the time I realized what had happened , I saw many injured and dead bodies strewn around me . I saw at least five or six dead bodies . . . Some people died on the spot and others were injured , said another eyewitness , Dhirendra Kumar , who had minor injuries on her hand . As I heard the blast , I stepped to the side and after 10 or 15 minutes , police came and took the injured to the hospital . . . This was the second blast to shake the Delhi High Court within the last four months . A low intensity bomb blast took place on May 25also a Wednesdaybut no one was hurt . . . Its a different story this time , however , and the scene at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital , where most of the injured were taken , presents a picture of chaos , shock , anger , and helplessness . The relatives of the victims havent been able to meet their loved ones , and the frequent visits of the politicians only ends up irritating the waiting kith and kin , who blame the government for being lax in tackling terror in the country . . . Meanwhile , the dozens of injured are being shunted from one hospital building to another . Adding to the surreal feel of it all are the TV crews , who have been running after each stretcher to thrust their microphones at the victims . . . I spoke to Dr. Sampoorna , who described the horrific scene inside the ward . . . I saw at least 12 to 14 dead bodies , she said . Some were without limbs , some were without legs , and some were beyond recognition . . . So far , 12 people are said to have died in the blast or from their injuries , with dozens more injured . . . As Rajeev noted yesterday , Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami ( HuJI ) , a Pakistan-based militant group with an affiliate in Bangladesh , claimed responsibility for the attack . In an e-mail sent to media houses , the terror group claims to have carried out the blast in retaliation for the death sentence given to Afzal Guru , who was convicted in connection with the attack on the Indian parliament in 2001 . . . While Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told parliament that there had been some intelligence relating to threats , shared with the Delhi Police in July , he refused to identify the group that had carried out the bomb blast . . . The attack comes at a time when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is on a historic visit to Bangladesh to bolster ties between the two neighbours , and some analysts see the attack as an attempt to divert attention from the landmark agreement signed between New Delhi and Dhaka . They argue that the attacks are designed to create a wedge between the two nations , and they point out that the serial strikes in Mumbai in July were on the eve of talks between the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan . . . Whatever the reason , the people of India are fed up with the governments failure to contain terrorism . A palpable sense of anger can be detected in the hospital , at the blast site , on the streets of the capital and in the TV studios . . . But no lawno matter how tough it iscan eradicate terrorism . We live in an environment where terrorism is a reality . And , since theres not a single group that can be blamed for these attacks , there isnt one motivation and therefore one solution . . . For now , at least , India seems destined to grapple with these tragic Wednesdays . . . . United Nations : The United Nations Security Council -LRB- UNSC -RRB- today joined UN Chief Ban Ki-moon in strongly condemning the deadly terror attack in LOC_Event , saying such `` heinous '' acts of terrorism are `` criminal and unjustifiable '' . Moon expressed solidarity with the government and people of India and reiterated `` his firm stance that there is no justification for indiscriminate violence against civilians , '' deputy UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey said.The Secretary-General `` hopes that the perpetrators will be brought to justice , '' Buey said.In a separate statement read by the current UN Security Council President , Lebanon 's envoy to the UN Nawaf Salam , the UNSC also `` condemned in the strongest terms '' the terrorist attack that killed 12 people and left over 60 injured . `` The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security , and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable , regardless of their motivation , wherever , whenever and by whomsoever committed , '' the 15-member council said.Expressing sympathy and condolences to families and victims of the `` heinous act '' , the Security Council said it is determined to combat all forms of terrorism . . Prime Minister Julia Gillard has condemned a deadly bomb attack at LOC_Event 's LOC_Event as an act of senseless violence . . . An Islamist militant group has reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack , in which at least 10 people have been killed and another 62 injured . . . `` The government and people of Australia unreservedly condemn the bombing , '' Ms Gillard said in a statement on Wednesday . . . `` Our thoughts are with the families of the innocent people who have been killed and with those injured by the blast . '' . . She said Australia continued to give its full support to India 's anti-terrorism work . . . The bomb went off after being hidden in a briefcase in a reception area where more than 100 people were waiting for passes to the court complex , located in the heart of the Indian capital . . .

NEW DELHI : Eleven people were killed and at least 76 others were injured in a powerful blast outside LOC_Event gate number 5 on Wednesday morning . The blast took place at around 10.15 am . Home secretary RK Singh told reporters the explosives were placed in a briefcase at the high court reception where hundreds of people come through every day to attend court cases . At the time of explosion around 200 people , mostly litigants were present at the gate in a quee to get their passes made to enter the court . There were several lawyers also present at the site . Later , a mail purportedly written by Bangladesh-based terror outfit Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami -LRB- HuJI -RRB- was sent to some media houses claiming responsibility . The mail claimed the explosion was carried out to demand repeal of death sentence of Afzal Guru , a condemned prisoner in Parliament attack . The government is investigating the email . Severed limbs and pieces of flesh lay strewn on the ground where there were pools of blood after the deafening explosion that dug a small crater outside the reception area . CCTVs to monitor visitors were not reportedly installed . This is for the second time in less than four months that the LOC_Event has been targeted . No one was injured in the previous explosion on May 25 . Delhi Police have released sketches of two people suspected of planting the bomb in a suitcase outside the court , just two km away from Parliament House . Special secretary -LRB- Internal Security -RRB- UK Bansal said preliminary probe indicated possible use of nitrate-based explosives laced with PETN . PETN , short for pentaerythritol trinitrate , is a chemical explosive that has a long history of terrorist use . The probe into the blast was handed over by Government to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- whose Chief S C Sinha said a 20-member team headed by a DIG has been formed . Home minister P Chidambaram said the blast was of ` high intensity ' and called it a ` terrorist attack ' . The previous major terror attack in the Capital was on September 13 , 2008 when a series of five synchronised bomb blasts took place within a span of few minutes at various locations in Delhi . 30 people were killed and over 100 injured in this strike . -LRB- With inputs from PTI -RRB- .

New Delhi : In a significant development , a suspected terrorist belonging to the terror outfit Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , believed to be involved in the LOC_Event serial blasts , was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police in LOC_Event on Friday morning . . . According to reports , the IM operative who has been identified as Maqbool was picked up following an intelligence tip-off about his movement . Maqbool is accused of making the Improvised Explosive Device that was used in the blast on August 1 . The IM terrorist is currently being deported to Delhi for further interrogation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police . . . This is the fifth arrest in connection with the August 1 Pune serial blasts . . . On August 17 , another suspected IM terrorist Langde Irfan was arrested in Jaipur by the Delhi Police . . . Irfan was apprehended from Jaipur ` s Sindhi bus stand on October 10 by a team of Delhi Police ` s Special Cell . . . Police is still on the lookout for one Raju Bhai , who allegedly arranged hideouts for three of the arrested persons , and another unidentified person . Delhi Police had earlier arrested three suspected IM operatives - Asad Khan ( 33 ) , who is a recruiter , motivator and ideologue of the IM , and Imran Khan ( 31 ) were arrested on September 26 from their hideout in Pul Prehladpur in south Delhi while Syed Firoze ( 38 ) was nabbed from Nizamuddin Railway station five days later . . . With Agency Inputs . PUNE : Investigators suspect that Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- operative Yasin Bhatkal , the man most wanted for a string of terror attacks across the country , planted one of the bombs on LOC_Event on August 1 , around four hours before four low-intensity blasts rocked LOC_Event . Sources told TOI that the investigators , while inspecting CCTV foot-age collected from various establishments on LOC_Event , zeroed in on a man , bearing a strong resemblance to Yasin , coming on a bicycle and parking it opposite the Sai Service petrol pump . The bomb , which was placed in a basket strapped on to the handle of the bicycle , did not go off . The bomb disposal squad later defused the explosive . ` The footage showed that after parking the bicycle there around 3 pm , the man left the spot quickly . After minutely going through the footage , the investigators strongly suspect the man to be Yasin Bhatkal , ' sources said . A key IM operative who also operates under the aliases Siddibappa and Shahrukh , Yasin is wanted for the German Bakery blast in which 17 people were killed , apart from several other blasts across the country . He has managed to evade the police since 2008 . His image was also captured on CCTV at the German Bakery on February 13 , 2010 . Sources said the investigators have identified three more persons who they suspect are involved in the LOC_Event blasts . One of them is believed to be Kondhwa resident Mohsin Chaudhury , another key IM operative , who has been on the run since 2008 . The investigators ' strong suspicion that the man seen in the CCTV footage could be Yasin is strengthened by the fact that the IM operative is known to personally go to sites of the different blasts he is believed to have engineered across the country . ` Yasin is known to himself direct terror attacks and provide support to other bomb planters . The investigators are also examining the CCTV footage of a few days before the LOC_Event blasts , ' the sources said . Amitesh Kumar , additional commissioner of police of the state anti-terrorism squad , said , ' I do n't have any such information about the man -LRB- Yasin Bhatkal -RRB- . ' In Mumbai , sources from the security establishment said that Yasin is a ` weird person ' who is capable of planting the bombs himself . ` But in this case , we are not sure as of now , ' an official said . Yasin 's name first came up in 2008 after the arrest of IM operatives from Pune and Mangalore . Investigators said he had gone to Pakistan for terror training and knows how to assemble bombs . In the Mumbai 13/7 serial blasts , the investigators suspected Yasin of having personally given explosives and detonators to his aides to be delivered to Mumbai . In November 2011 , Delhi Police arrested four IM men , including Pakistani national Mohammed Adil , Mohammed Qateel Siddiqui , Gauhar Aziz Khomani and Gayoor Jamali from the capital 's Nangloi area . During interrogation , they told the police that Yasin and his father-in-law , Mohammed Irshad Khan , had fled the place immediately after news of the arrests had leaked out . Police then learnt that Yasin was staying with Irshad Khan at a relative 's house in Selaiyur , Chennai . The Delhi police raided the house and arrested Irshad , but Yasin , who had gone to the market , slipped away . LOC_Event : . . 2.35 pm : Delhi police sends special team to Pune .

PUNE/NEW DELHI : Less than 24 hours after minor blasts rocked Pune , security experts on Thursday were stunned by evidence that the serial explosions were part of a full-blown terror attack , which providentially went awry , preventing mass casualties on the city 's bustling LOC_Event . An official said a design flaw in the bombs caused them to explode partially and prevented the shrapnel from spreading . Without naming any group , a top home ministry official in New Delhi said there were ` credible leads ' pointing to a ` big plan ' by a terror outfit . ` Preliminary forensic result which is an outcome of the detailed examination of the two unexploded IEDs and nature of blasts shows that the bomb had all the ingredients to cause a much bigger impact and had the potential to take lives of many people . ' In LOC_Event , police bomb experts who supervised dismantling of the devices also said the four bombs placed on LOC_Event road on Wednesday evening exploded only partly . Had these and the two that were defused gone off fully , the damage caused would have been ` major ' , they said . A bomb disposal officer , speaking on condition of anonymity , told TOI each bomb contained two or three detonators , a nine-volt battery , a circuit , a timer , ball bearings and a yellow sticky substance . ` The design of the bombs was faulty , due to which they did not explode fully . The bearings were by and large intact even in the devices that went off . Had the bombs exploded fully , the bearings could have injured several people , ' he said . The officer said at least five detonators did not explode . ` We defused these detonators at our office at Shivajinagar , ' he said . The expert said a sticky substance covered the detonators , batteries and bearings in each bomb . ` We have sent the substance to the state forensic laboratory for chemical analysis , ' he said . Police were probing whether the bombs contained ammonium nitrate , a powerful explosive . On Wednesday , police had said there were four blasts and one device had been defused before the timer could go off . Sources in New Delhi , meanwhile , said the manner in which digital wristwatches were used as timers and the detonator circuits along with the way bombs were kept on three newly-bought bicycles , one dustbin and two polythene bags were similar to the technique adopted by the banned terror group Indian Mujahideen . The terror outfit had adopted a similar modus operandi in the serial blasts in Lucknow , Faizabad and Varanasi in November , 2007 and in Jaipur in May , 2008 . Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde and home secretary R K Singh , however , remained reticent about the horrific revelations . ` We have taken it very seriously , ' said Shinde , indicating that the low-intensity blasts were not being dismissed as a mere messaging by a terror group and the government was aware of a carefully-scripted plan . ` Since the blasts have taken place within an area of 500 metres and within a span of 45 minutes , it appears to be a coordinated act . I am sure there was a plan behind it , ' said home secretary R K Singh . Meanwhile , Pune police on Thursday identified the shop from where two of the three new bicycles were purchased by the terrorists . Officers said two men bought the bicycles from Soni Cycle Trading Company at Phadke Haud , Budhwar Peth , around 11am on Wednesday , about eight hours before the first bomb went off . The police have questioned the owner of the shop , his brother and two employees and based on descriptions given by them , sketches of the two men have been prepared . The shop owner also told police the two men were speaking Gujarati . A senior police officer from the crime branch told TOI that the shop was traced with the help of serial numbers embossed on the bicycles . ` We searched several bicycle shops in the Phadke Haud area , ' an officer said . The officer said police have also taken CCTV footage from a firecracker shop in Shaniwar Peth . ` The shop owner has installed a high-resolution camera at his shop . The camera is facing the road . We are suspecting that the duo may have used the road in front of the shop . ' Meanwhile , police are still questioning Dayanand Patil , the man injured in first of the blasts at LOC_Event . Cops also questioned his wife , Satyakala , in Pune and recorded her statement . Police said Patil had visited either Jordan or Dubai in 2003 . They have seized his passport and are trying to ascertain the reason for his visit abroad . Police refused to say whether he was being seen as a suspect in the blasts . Patil works as a tailor at a laundry on Shirole road , a few metres from LOC_Event . He lives in Urulikanchan , 20 km from the city , with his wife and three-year-old daughter . Zeenews Bureau . .

MUMBAI : In a twist to the LOC_Event serial blasts case , Maharashtra home minister R R Patil on Thursday said the Pune police commissioner had received an anonymous letter a few days ago , warning that the death of Qateel Siddiqui in police custody would be avenged . The police had identified Qateel as an Indian Mujahideen operative allegedly involved in several terror cases , including the German Bakery blast and the Bangalore terror attack . He was strangled to death by his two inmates at the Yerawada jail in Pune in June . ' A letter , written in Marathi , indicating that Qateel 's death had become a major flashpoint , was received by the Pune police , ' Patil said , adding , ` According to preliminary reports , ammonium nitrate was used . But the department is awaiting a detailed report from the forensic laboratory on this . ' Although the letter is anonymous , the investigating team is looking into its source . ATS and crime branch teams have formed to probe the blast case . Besides the anonymous letter , all other possible angles , too , are being scanned by the investigating team . Minister of state for home Satej Patil said , ` Electronic timer and square batteries were used in explosives . ' The investigating agencies are also trying to find out how Dayanand Patil came in contact with the bomb . CCTV footage , which is available , is being scanned by the investigating team . With the festival season to begin soon , the state government held a high-level internal security meeting in Mantralaya . ` In the meeting , the law and order situation , especially security arrangements in Mumbai , Pune , Thane and other metros ahead of festivals like Dahi-Handi , Id and Ganeshotsav , were reviewed , ' said a senior home department official . ` Even coastal security was discussed in the meeting , ' the official added . Newly appointed director general of police -LRB- DGP -RRB- , Sanjeev Dayal , briefed chief minister Prithviraj Chavan about the Pune blast and the law and order situation in the state , it is learnt . The Delhi Police on Thursday claimed to have cracked the August 1 serial blasts in Pune by arresting three suspected militants of the Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- . The police said they were planning to carry out a similar operation in the Capital during the coming festival season and another at a famous temple in LOC_Event . While raw materials for configuring improvised explosive devices -LRB- IED -RRB- were purportedly seized from them , the police are now on the lookout for some more members of the module . . . At a press conference , Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said the Special Cell had smashed the IM module behind the LOC_Event blasts , which were masterminded by alleged outfit founder-brothers Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal to avenge the killing of suspected IM member Qateel Siddique in Punes Yerwada Jail by two other jail inmates on June 8 . . . The police chief said the vital lead came from Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal , one of the alleged handlers of the 26/11 LOC_Event attack terrorists deported from Saudi Arabia in June . . . Jundal disclosed that plans were afoot to target major Indian cities . He was in touch with the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant Fayyaz Qagzi from Beed in Maharashtra who is now in a west Asian country . Mr. Qagzi was coordinating with Riyaz and Iqbal of Indian Mujahideen , now in Pakistan , to carry out the strikes , said Mr. Kumar . . . The police claim they identified the IM module hideout at Pul Prahladpur in South Delhi from where Asad Khan -LRB- 33 -RRB- , a resident of Aurangabad , and Imran Khan -LRB- 31 -RRB- , a resident of Nanded in Maharashtra , were arrested on September 26 . . . The accused disclosed that they had come here at the instance of Mr. Qagzi and the Bhatkal brothers , with the objective of triggering blasts at crowded places . The suspects were first received at the Nehru Place in South Delhi by a conduit codenamed Raju Bhai , who had taken the Pul Prahladpur house on rent and made arrangements for their long stay . . . The accused disclosed that they , along with other members , were involved in the LOC_Event blasts . One of them , identified as Sayed Feroz -LRB- 38 -RRB- from LOC_Event , was then arrested at the Nizamuddin railway station on October 1 , said Mr. Kumar . . . The trio purportedly disclosed that the module first planned to plant a bomb at the Yerwada Jail or the city court premises or target relatives of the two jail inmates who had allegedly killed Mr. Siddique . Heavy police presence at the jail and court premises , coupled with their failure to identify the inmates relatives , led them to weigh the possibility of carrying out a strike in Mumbai or LOC_Event . . . As instructed , the suspects met at Asads tour and travel office in Aurangabad in July , following which Mr. Feroz took a flat on rent at Kasarwadi in LOC_Event . Two other suspects joined them later . . . They brought explosives and electronic items for assembling IEDs from an electrical/electronic market in Budhwarpeth LOC_Event They also bought digital watches and circuit boards , while ball bearings were brought by Imran from Nanded . The accused conducted reconnaissance of certain places in Mumbai , but the Bhatkal brothers later fixed it for Pun . . . The module finally identified the citys busy Junglee Maharaj Road , and on the fateful day , the accused bought three bicycles , parked them at a stand close to a bus-stand and in the evening , planted half-a-dozen IEDs along the road before vanishing from the scene . . . Mr. Feroz owns a garment shop named Options in the busy Mominpura area of LOC_Event , where he also stays with his family . While his house was found locked , neighbours refused to speak but confirmed that he stayed with his wife and four children . . . His business partner Mohsin said Mr. Feroz was in the city till September-end . We met him about 10-12 days ago . After that he has not been in town , he said . Mohsin said he had known Mr. Feroz for the last three years , and had not suspected anything about him till date . It is a shock for all of us to see that he has been arrested . Maybe , his wife and kids have left the house as journalists started coming in , he said adding that Mr. Feroz usually travelled to source the material from other cities but this time he did not know why he went out of LOC_Event . . . -LRB- With inputs from Amruta Byatnal from LOC_Event -RRB- .

The duo killed Siddique as he boasted that his group would carry out a blast at LOC_Event , a famous LOC_Event in LOC_Event . . . The investigation into his murder revealed that he was part of a bigger conspiracy and led to the arrest the three IM operatives in Delhi . . . The three arrested persons were reportedly close to fugitive Indian Mujahideen chief Yasin Bhatkal . The police had on 27 March arrested another suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorist , an alleged aide of Bhatkal , from north-east Delhi with one kg explosives and a detonator . Assadullah Rehman alias Dilkash ( 20 ) was apprehended from Chandu Nagar in Karawal Nagar . Dilkash , who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar , had allegedly escaped in November 2011 from the arms factory run by Indian Mujahideen in west Delhi 's Nangloi before the police crackdown during which a number of suspected terrorists were nabbed by police . . . A senior police official said Dilkash had told police that he had recently taken on rent a premises at Chandu Nagar from where investigators allegedly recovered one kg of explosive powder , a detonator , a timer and a mobile phone . `` He came in contact with Mohd Kafeel Ahmad , the motivator and ideologue of Indian Mujahideen , who was arrested earlier . He was motivated by Ahmad to join Indian Mujahideen . In February 2011 , Ahmad introduced him to Bhatkal who further motivated him , '' the official said . . . In April 2011 , the official said , on instructions from Bhatkal , he reached Delhi and was taken to the factory at Meer Vihar in Nangloi which was later busted by police . There he learnt to work on the lathe machine and assisted Mohd Irshad and Bhatkal in allegedly manufacturing pistols and other arms and ammunition . `` He became a trusted aide of Bhatkal , '' the official claimed . With inputs from PTI . LOC_Event : Maharashtra Police has prepared sketches of two persons who may have planted explosives in LOC_Event as investigators suspect the involvement of at least three persons in executing the 1 August serial bomb blasts here . . . `` The sketches of two persons who could be bomb planters are ready . It will not be made public but would be given to the policemen involved in the investigations , '' a police officer told PTI today . . . `` Initial probe suggest that the there could be at least three suspects who have planted bombs that exploded within an area of 500 meters , '' the official added . . . On Wednesday , four low intensity explosions took place between 7.37 and 8.15 pm during rush hour in the heart of LOC_Event on LOC_Event , LOC_Event , LOC_Event and the large LOC_Event , popular for family outings in the evening . . . The explosions occurred near LOC_Event Dena Bank branch , a LOC_Event outlet and LOC_Event . The first bomb went off at LOC_Event where one person identified as Dayanand Patil was injured . . . The National Investigation Agency , Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad and LOC_Event crime branch have been conducting the probe into the blasts simultaneously . . . The investigators have also approached mobile operators to verify if any new numbers were traced in and around the spots on the fateful day . . . `` We have approached mobile companies seeking the details of new numbers or suspicious numbers their towers have captured before and after the blasts . There will be lakhs of calls a tower catches in a few minutes . In this mammoth task , we have to go through all these numbers and zero in on the numbers used by suspects , '' the official added . . . Official sources in Delhi had yesterday said that wrist watches were used to trigger the serial blasts and the manner in which this was done with detonators kept on three newly-bought bicycles , two dustbins and a polythene bag was similar to the technique adopted by banned home grown terror group Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) . LOC_Event : Maharashtra Home Minister RR Patil on Friday said that investigating agencies were probing all angles to determine whether any terror outfit was behind the low intensity serial bomb blasts that rocked the city on Wednesday . . . Whether it was a terrorist act or not will be determined only after proper investigations are carried out by Maharashtra ATS , city crime branch and central agencies , Patil said . . . Agencies . . Four coordinated low-intensity explosions struck the busy arterial Jangli Maharaj ( JM ) road in the heart of LOC_Event on Wednesday . The explosions occurred near LOC_Event , LOC_Event , a LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . . Asked whether there could be a saffron terror angle to the incident , he said , All angles are being probed and it will not be proper to comment at this stage . . . He said the person injured in one of the blasts near LOC_Event was being treated for minor injuries . . . The injured person Dayanand Patil , who hails from a nearby village of Uruli Kanchan , had reportedly visited the spot opposite the Balgandharva Theatre , where a dharna agitation by India Against Corruption was in progress . . . After he left the place , the explosive , which had apparently been put in his carry bag , exploded on the way , police sources said . . . Unconfirmed reports said ammonium nitrate could have been the substance used in the blast triggered by small detonators and pencil cells . . . Police have also issued an advisory to IAC activists to wind up the dharna pandal for security reasons . . . Life in the city returned to normal late night as the blasts did not cause any large-scale damage . Police have appealed to people to ignore rumours and carry on daily routine without fear . Ahmedabad : Gujarat was put on high alert today following the low intensity serial bomb blasts in LOC_Event last night , police said . . . `` High alert is in force in the state and will remain till 15 August , the Independence Day , '' said Chittaranjan Singh , In-charge Director General of Police ( DGP ) , Gujarat . . . `` After that we will review the situation and take an appropriate decision , '' he added . . . LOC_Event blast . PTI . . The police in Gujarat has been asked to be on ` stand to ' mode to counter any untoward incident . The quick response teams ( QRTs ) and special operation groups ( SOGs ) across the state have been alerted . . . Patrolling at all sensitive and strategic locations has been intensified . Checking of suspected vehicles and those at entry and exits of cities like LOC_Event , Vadodara , Surat and Rajkot have been intensified , police officials said . . . `` Checking at hotels , guest houses , bus and railway station have also been intensified , '' said Joint Commissioner of Police ( JCP ) , Sector I , LOC_Event Ajay Tomar . . . `` We are taking as much precautions as we can to avert any untoward incident , '' he said . . . LOC_Event had experienced terror in July 2008 , when a series of 20 bomb blasts rocked it , killing 56 people and injuring more than 200 , within a span of 70 minutes . HYDERABAD : The twin blasts that rocked LOC_Event on Thursday evening was waiting to happen as the city police were repeatedly ignoring alerts by the Centre about impending strikes at the very place where scores lost their lives . In August last year , the Delhi Police , after busting a module of Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- , had warned LOC_Event of possible terror strikes by IM , but the police did not act on it , said senior home ministry sources . One of the arrested militant , called Maqbool , a resident of Nanded in Maharashtra , knew the topography of LOC_Event and had helped IM members in carrying out a recce of Dilsukhnagar , Begum Bazar and Abids in on a motorcycle . The information was passed to Hyderabad 's cops and they were told to beef up security , but the local cops brushed the information aside saying these were ` routine ' . Maqbool , who began his career along with a criminal called Azam Gauri of Warangal , told police about plans to strike in Hyderabad as it was a soft spot . ` We had information of militants staying at the LOC_Event and LOC_Event was definitely on their minds , ' said a senior official on condition of anonymity . Last December , following reports of possible Taliban attacks to avenge Ajmal Kasab 's execution in a Pune jail , the centre again warned the city police . However , police told reporters on November 30 that they had not received any intelligence inputs of a suspected terror attack in the city . Anurag Sharma , the Police Commissioner said that police were prepared to shield the city and said patrolling has been intensified as a part of precautionary measure . ` We have not got any such report from any intelligence agency . However , we remain alert to any such threat , ' he had said . A Pakistani Taliban group had warned of attacks in LOC_Event and LOC_Event to avenge Kasab 's death within a month . LOC_Event and LOC_Event were also on their target . Kasab , who was the lone surviving gunman of the 26/11 LOC_Event terror attacks , was hanged at Pune 's Yerwada Jail on Nov 21 . His execution along with Afzal Guru , is believed to have angered several terror groups who vowed to avenge their deaths . Hyderabad : As the Hyderabad Police continues investigations in the serial blasts case , six people have been detained for questioning . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- is conducting raids at various places in Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and Maharashtra , looking for alleged terror modules . While the Hyderabad Police has been cautious in not naming any particular group or individual , intelligence agencies say the role of the Indian Mujahideen ca n't be ruled out . View PhotosHyderabad , Feb 23 : Hours within twin bomb blasts in Hyderabad , police seem to have tracked some of the suspects who are allegedly seen in executing the terror plans . . . Closed Circuit Television ( CCTV ) camera footage , which were collected from the traffic signal near the blast site in LOC_Event , captured movements of five men who allegedly had planted explosives at the blast sites . . . According to police sources , a man seems to be in his early 30s was seen reaching near the site on a bi-cycle . A bag was hung on his cycle . The suspect reached the place ten minutes before the first blast at LOC_Event in front of Konark theatre at 6:38 pm . The second blast occurred few metres away at 7:01 pm . . . However , the face of the suspects are not clear in the footage , hence the police has sought help of experts , sources said . Meanwhile , the investigating group also announced reward between Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh to those who will provide any information regarding the suspects . . . Police officials earlier were quoted as saying , `` We are examining the images at the moment . The pictures are not too clear , but we should be able to get something out of it . '' . . Total 16 people were killed and over 100 people were injured in the twin blasts on Thursday , Feb 21 . A team of investigators reportedly would visit Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and Jharkhand soon to nab few other suspects . . . OneIndia News . . . Hyderabad , Feb. 21 : At least 13 people were killed in multiple blasts near movie halls as well as bus stands in a teeming commercial and educational hub of Hyderabad this evening , 48 hours after the Centre had passed on to the states usual fears of a reprisal for Afzal Gurus execution . . . Officials said the toll could rise as more than 80 people were injured in at least two explosions at LOC_Event , 5km from the landmark Charminar and known for markets , education institutes and as an avenue for quick getaway because of its proximity to a highway . A third bomb was defused later . . . No direct link was established till late tonight between the hanging of the Parliament attack convict less than a fortnight ago and the explosions . The Prime Minister appealed for calm and requested citizens to maintain peace . . . But the Union home ministry as well as Andhra Pradesh police appeared to have more or less concluded that the explosions were the handiwork of terrorists . Union home secretary R.K. Singh said in Delhi that the near-simultaneous and powerful blasts indicated a terror attack . . . Andhra DGP V. Dinesh Reddy said improvised explosive devices were used in the two blasts . . . The bombs the first explosion was thought to be a gas cylinder blast because of eateries in the vicinity known for evening snacks appeared to have been placed and timed to cause maximum damage . . . The first device went off around 7pm near an eatery opposite Konark movie hall , killing five to six people on the spot . . . Within two to three minutes and before bystanders could recover from the impact , another explosion took place around 100 metres away . The location this time was another crowded area a bus stand close to Venkatadri theatre . . . Six persons were suspected to have been killed in the immediate aftermath of the second blast . But since the intensity of this explosion was larger than the first one , more casualties are feared . . . The diabolical nature of the plot was evident as the blast took place just when the evening show had ended at Venkatadri and the viewers were pouring out . The belt has at least 10 bus shelters in a row , usually bustling with passengers and vendors . . . Because of the second day of the general strike , the traffic on the route was slightly less today , said Gopal Rao , a police officer in LOC_Event . . . DCP Ravi Verma said the bombs were planted on the backseats of two bicycles one near LOC_Event and another near the LOC_Event . The bombs were kept in steel lunch boxes normally used by day labourers . . . DGP Reddy said tonight that the police had defused another bomb near Sampoorna theatre in LOC_Event , around 5km from LOC_Event . . . Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde spoke of intelligence inputs for the past two days , which were shared with all states , but he added that there was no specific information like this . . . Official sources said a general alert was issued for two consecutive days from February 19 to all major cities , suggesting a possible attack by Pakistan-based terror groups to avenge the hangings of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and 26/11 gunman Ajmal Kasab . . . Some intelligence officers said such alerts were routine and usually not actionable ( so sketchy that little action is possible ) , but they cautioned that they were speaking from experience and not about this particular case . . . A team of forensic experts of the National Security Guard was tonight flown to Hyderabad . Members from the Chennai hub of the Black Cat commando force have also been sent to the Andhra Pradesh capital . . . State intelligence teams have been checking on several suspects , including two recently acquitted in a case related to Gujarat . Police sources claimed that a person arrested recently had confessed in Delhi that he had surveyed LOC_Event in December 2012 . Two powerful explosions ripped through crowded areas at LOC_Event in the eastern part of the State capital on Thursday evening , killing 13 persons and injuring more than 83 . . . The first blast occurred at 6.50 p.m. on the citys busiest road that links it with Vijayawada ; as terrified people were scampering to safety , the second blast went off . . . Authorities say the explosions were caused by improvised explosive devices that could have been kept on bicycles or packed inside frames of bicycles . . . The twin blasts brought back painful memories of the August 25 , 2007 IED attacks in LOC_Event , in front of the State secretariat , and at LOC_Event in LOC_Event that killed 44 people . . . Incidentally , one of Thursdays blasts took place near a crowded foot over-bridge , where security forces defused an IED five years ago . The device was to go off along with the blasts in LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . . Eyewitnesses at Anand Tiffin Centre , near the spot where the first blast took place , said someone began shouting about a bomb going off . Even as confused people watched , the IED detonated . NEW DELHI : As investigators trawl the devastated spots in Hyderabad 's Dilsukhnagar for clues to Thursday 's twin blasts , a debate has begun in the home ministry over whether the terror attack could have been prevented . According to reports reaching here , there is no breakthrough yet for the investigators . ` We are still groping in the dark , ' a senior home ministry official familiar with the details of the probe said . However , there was relief after it turned out that some of the CCTV cameras in the ill-fated locality were functional at the time of the explosions on Thursday evening and , therefore , might be holding pointers . Senior sources disputed reports that the wires of CCTV cameras had been snapped four days ago . The MHA had fewer doubts on Friday about the involvement of Indian Mujahideen in the attack . The bombs carried the signature of IM . Both the devices were packed with ammonium nitrate and shrapnel with a timer mechanism : the staple of IM bomb-makers . The use of cycles to strap bombs has also been an IM trademark since November 2007 when they attacked courts in UP . Both bombs were designed to ensure that the impact of explosions was concentrated on one side : again a stock in trade for IM which has used boat-shaped devices earlier in order to maximize casualties . Faced with allegations of intelligence failure in Parliament , home minister Sushilkumar Shinde pointed out that the Centre has issued a series of alerts to authorities in Hyderabad about a possible terrorist reprisal against the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru . The first advisory went out on Saturday , alerting states against the threat of United Jehad Council to launch a fresh terror campaign against India to avenge Guru 's hanging . The message was amplified by Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed . Although the first alert was general in nature , intelligence agencies , acting on basis of intercepts , refined it to caution that Hyderabad , along with Mumbai , Bangalore , Coimbatore and Hubli and certain places in Gujarat and Maharashtra , could be on the hit list of terrorists desperate to make good their threat . This message highlighting the threat to LOC_Event was sent on February 19 . The following day , Intelligence Bureau asked the states to step up vigil at places which were known to be on the radar of terrorists and had been recced . Centre 's concern , prompted by clear inputs according to Shinde , that a terrorist strike could be in the works manifested itself again on February 20 , when it repeated that LOC_Event could be among the likely targets along with other places . The same anxiety led the government to sound the same alert anew on Thursday morning just eight hours before the bombs went off in LOC_Event , killing at least 16 and maiming many more . LOC_Event fitted the bill , having been surveyed by an IM module as recently as last year . Delhi Police had on the basis of testimonies of two alleged IM terrorists , Syed Maqbool and Imran , told Andhra authorities that the locality was recceed as recently in July last year . Sources in the home ministry said that the emphasis on the sites which had already been reconnoitered reflected the assessment that the terrorists were under pressure to do something spectacular sooner than later and , hence , focussed on locales they were already familiar with . Centre refrained from blaming the state government , with Shinde saying in Rajya Sabha that the calm professionalism of AP cops was worth emulating . But many in his own ministry wondered whether cops could have prevented the carnage by upping their guard in response to a series of advisories . There was also puzzlement about the reasons why they failed to do so despite the fact that terrorists had targeted the same spot in 2007 . The last attempt failed only because the device planted by IM terrorists failed to go off , sparing the locality the devastation caused by the bombs the same module led by Riyaz Bhatkal had planted at Gokul Chat Bhandar and Lumbini Park . According to sources , one possible explanation could be the fatigue among cops over having to deal with the same kind of alerts over and over again . They said the counter-terror advisories issued in the wake of Guru 's hanging were not different from those which were sent after Mumbai attacker Ajmal Kasab was sent to the gallows in November . The alerts issued after Kasab 's execution had mentioned LOC_Event along with Bangalore and Coimbatore among the vulnerable spots . Speaking in Rajya Sabha , Shinde emphasized that the Centre had strong reasons to hoist the caution sign higher after February 19 and afterwards . If this was the case , the authorities clearly failed to impress the urgency upon the men at ground zero Sources said that the routine of having to respond to the same kind of cues repeatedly could not but lead to a dulling of response : a vulnerability which could be exploited by a terrorist group set on a particular target as has been the case with IM and LOC_Event . The predominantly Hindu locality with a history of communal tension has been consistently targeted by terrorists since 1999 when they unsuccessfully planted a bomb there . The terrorists returned again in 2002 when a bomb claimed two lives . Residents were lucky in 2007 when the bomb planted there did not go off , but the determined group had had their way on Thursday . Two powerful explosions ripped through crowded areas at LOC_Event in the eastern part of the State capital on Thursday evening , killing 13 persons and injuring more than 83 . . . The first blast occurred at 6.50 p.m. on the citys busiest road that links it with Vijayawada ; as terrified people were scampering to safety , the second blast went off . . . Authorities say the explosions were caused by improvised explosive devices that could have been kept on bicycles or packed inside frames of bicycles . . . The twin blasts brought back painful memories of the August 25 , 2007 IED attacks in LOC_Event , in front of the State secretariat , and at LOC_Event in LOC_Event that killed 44 people . . . Incidentally , one of Thursdays blasts took place near a crowded foot over-bridge , where security forces defused an IED five years ago . The device was to go off along with the blasts in LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . . Eyewitnesses at Anand Tiffin Centre , near the spot where the first blast took place , said someone began shouting about a bomb going off . Even as confused people watched , the IED detonated . Two bombs exploded in a crowded shopping district in the southern Indian city of LOC_Event , killing at least 12 people and wounding 50 more in the worst blasts in the country in more than a year , officials said . . . The explosions occurred about two minutes apart in the early evening outside a cinema and a bus station . Storefronts were shattered , motorcycles covered in debris , and food and plates from a roadside restaurant were scattered on the ground near a tangle of dead bodies . . . `` This is a dastardly attack , the guilty will not go unpunished , '' Manmohan Singh , the prime minister , said . He appealed to the public to remain calm . . . The bombs were attached to two bicycles in the Dilsukh Nagar district , Sushilkumar Shinde , home minister , said . The district is a shopping area near a residential neighbourhood . . . Eight people died in one explosion and three in the other , Shinde explained . . . Mahesh Kumar , a 21-year-old student , was heading home from a tutoring class when one of the bombs went off . . . `` I heard a huge sound and something hit me , I fell down , and somebody brought me to the hospital , '' said Kumar , who suffered shrapnel wounds . . . LOC_Event , which has a population of more than seven million , is a hub of India 's information technology industry and has a mixed population of Muslims and Hindus . . . The explosions were the first major bomb attack to hit India since a September 2011 blast outside the high court in New Delhi killed 13 people . The government has been heavily criticised for its failure to arrest the masterminds behind previous bombings . . . Home secretary RK Singh said officials from the National Investigation Agency and commandos of the National Security Guards were leaving Delhi for Hyderabad , the capital of Andhra Pradesh . . . Rana Banerji , a former security official , said India remained vulnerable to such attacks because there was poor co-ordination between the national government and the states . . . Police reforms were also moving very slowly and the quality of intelligence gathering was poor , he said . . . `` The concept of homeland security should be made effective , on a war footing , '' he said . . . India has been on a state of alert since Mohammed Afzal Guru , a Kashmiri , was executed in a Delhi jail nearly two weeks ago . Guru had been convicted of involvement in a 2001 attack on India 's parliament that left 14 people dead , including five gunmen . . . Many in Indian-ruled Kashmir believe Guru did not receive a fair trial , and the secrecy with which the execution was carried out fuelled anger in a region where anti-India sentiment runs deep . . . . Zeenews Bureau . . New Delhi : Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh has strongly condemned the bomb blasts that occurred in LOC_Event on Thursday evening . The Prime Ministers Office posted on Twitter , ` This is a dastardly attack , the guilty will not go unpunished ( sic ) ' . . .

One bomb has been found to be un exploded near a foot bridge . . . As per reports more than 50 people have have been injured in the blasts and have been rushed to the nearby hospital . Zeenews Bureau . . New Delhi : Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj slammed Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday and termed his statement on the Hyderabad blasts as routine . . . Routine statements are not enough , said Swaraj . Cornering the government in view of reports that the Centre had prior intelligence on the possibility of a terror strike , she said , The Centre ` s role doesn ` t end after warning states about terror threats . If the Centre had information , then why did it not do anything to prevent the blasts ? . . She said that the time is not to play blame games but to stand united . . . Earlier in the day , she said , `` We can be united only when our thoughts in fighting terror are similar . The Home Minister himself is saying that he gave the information . But , if there was information , the blame doubles . If there was information , what was the Centre , the state doing ? `` . . `` The nation needs to be united ; the political parties need to get united . The moment that happens , we will be capable of fighting terror , ' Swaraj said in the Lok Sabha . . . Asserting that terrorists have no religion , Sushma said : ` Terrorists only follow the code of terrorism . We need to be united against terrorism . ' . . She further said that this is not the moment to lay blame , but to work together to combat terrorism . . .

New Delhi : Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( MIM ) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has strongly condemned BJP leader Sushma Swaraj for linking him and his brother MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi to the LOC_Event serial blasts case . in her speech in Parliament on Friday , Leader of Opposition Swaraj had linked Owaisi brothers with the twin blasts which claimed 16 lives . . . During her speech in Parliament , Swaraj had wondered if the twin blasts had to do with provocative speeches by Asaduddin Owaisi or his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi . `` Do these blasts have a connection with the provocative speeches made by an honourable member of this house ? '' she asked , initiating an impromptu discussion . . . Reacting to Swarajs remarks , the Hyderabad MP said the remarks were `` unfortunate '' and `` irresponsible '' . . . `` Swaraj can hate me , but she should have waited for the investigations to conclude before politically exploiting the issue . Most of those killed were from my constituency . Five of them were Muslims . Terror does not discriminate between religion , '' Hindustan Times has quoted Owaisi as saying . . . Slamming Swaraj , Owaisi said , `` One does n't accept such irresponsible statements from the Leader of the Opposition and one of the contenders for the PM 's post at a time when the last rites of the martyrs have not yet been performed . '' . . He described the bombings as an `` attack on the nation '' . He further said despite differences with the Congress government , his party was `` extending all cooperation '' to maintain calm and peace . . . googletag.display ( ` div-gpt-ad-1415181470682-6 ' ) ; . . googletag.display ( ` div-gpt-ad-1415181470682-6 ' ) ; . . .

France is ready to offer all cooperation that India may require , ' the statement said . The US has strongly condemned the `` cowardly attack '' in LOC_Event that claimed many lives , saying that it stood with India in battling the `` scourge of terrorism '' and offered its assistance in probing the incident . WASHINGTON : UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has joined the international community in condemning the terrorist attack in LOC_Event that killed more than a dozen people and wounded scores of others . . . `` The Secretary-General strongly condemns the indiscriminate attacks against civilians which occurred in the Indian city of LOC_Event , '' said a statement issued by the office of the UN Secretary General yesterday . . . `` He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government and people of India , '' the statement said . Director General of Police V. Dinesh Reddy has said that improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- with nitro compound were used in the explosions that killed 13 persons and left 83 injured . . . He did not hazard a guess whether RDX was used in the bombs but asserted that they were timed as the two powerful explosions took place within a gap of three minutes and were only hundred yards apart . . . Mr. Reddy , who returned from New Delhi only on Thursday after attending a meeting convened by the Central government to discuss the naxalite situation in various affected states , drove straight from the airport to the scene of the twin blasts at 7.10 p.m. . . Talking to media persons later , Mr. Reddy said the first blast took place at 6.58 p.m. near LOC_Event and the second three minutes later near LOC_Event . The bombs were placed in rexine bags and hung to bicycles at both the places . The locations were selected strategically to inflict maximum damage as they were crowded areas . . . No signs of more bombs were available after sanitising the entire area . A massive search operation in and around the locations was taken up in fear of more blasts . . . Mr. Reddy said that it was too premature to suspect the role of any particular group in the blasts . He denied picking up anybody or coming to know of any similarities with earlier explosions at Lumbini Park or Gokul Chat in 2007 . . . A high alert was sounded across the State and the Centre despatched rapid action force personnel to deal with the situation . A post-energy blast team that specialises in tackling this kind of blasts , also left New Delhi for LOC_Event . The investigation was being handed over to the National Investigation Agency , he said . . . The DGP appealed to the people not to panic as the police were fully geared to meet the situation . He hoped there would be a breakthrough in investigation soon . He also said the Union Home Secretary R.K. Singh and IB chief Asif Ibrahim were in constant touch with him . It was the third time in last decade that Dilsukhnagar has been targeted by terrorists . The bustling residential-commercial centre had earlier witnessed a bomb blast at LOC_Event in 2002 , which claimed two lives . . . Five years later , Hyderabad experienced twin blasts at LOC_Event in Kothi and Lumbini Park in front of the Secretariat . The terrorists had also planted a bomb at the foot over bridge in Dilsukhnagar , but it was detected and defused in time . And now again by a quirk of fate , five years later , the same area is rocked by blasts . . . Why do the terror planners keep returning to Dilsukhnagar ? Is it because of the high concentration of crowds so that maximum damage could be inflicted ? . . Located almost on the south-eastern tip of the city , Dilsukhnagar ranks high among the densely populated and busy corridors of Hyderabad . Given the numerous middle class colonies in the vicinity , the central Dilsukhnagar area around the bus stop teems with crowds throughout the day , peaking during the evenings . . . The bus stop here connects to almost all the parts of the city and thus has a large fleet of buses making a halt here to pick up and drop commuters . In the 1980s and 90s , Dilsukhnagar was the most preferred location by the government employees for setting up home and even now , sundown sees a large administrative staff getting down from buses here to return home . . . The location is the last pick up point for passengers heading for Vijayawada , Guntur , Tenali and parts of the coastal region , which adds to the crowd presence here . Also , the surroundings of the bus stop here have metamorphosed into a beehive of commercial activity with road side kiosks to well furnished showrooms and a couple of film theatres . . . Also , the bomb attack site is close to the popular Sai Baba temple which draws devotees in large numbers , particularly on Thursday evening when aarti is held around the sunset . . . With little or no mechanism to control and streamline the movement of crowds along or across the roads , chaotic conditions prevail particularly between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. . . At the same time , the area does not get adequate attention from security agencies . The focus that is paid to other parts of the main city or even the emerging IT corridors on peripheries is not accorded here . The Hyderabad Police had information that two suspected Indian Mujahideen members , arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell four months ago in connection with last Augusts LOC_Event serial blasts , had revealed that they surveyed Dilsukhnagar . . . The police have in the final report submitted before a city court mentioned that suspects Sayed Maqbool and Imran Khan had in July last year conducted reconnaissance of Dilsukhnagar and Begam Bazar in Hyderabad to identify a target . This , they purportedly revealed , was done at the behest of Riyaz Bhatkal , alleged to be the IMs founder member . . . The court is yet to take cognisance of the final report in which charges under Section 120B -LRB- criminal conspiracy -RRB- of the Indian Penal Code , the Explosive Substances Act and the Unlawful Activities -LRB- Prevention -RRB- Act were filed against the two , along with three others . Maqbool was arrested at Shaheennagar in Hyderabad last October after the Special Cell arrested Imran and his accomplices Asad Khan , Sayed Feroz and Landge Irfan Mustafa for their alleged role in the LOC_Event blasts . . . However , following the arrests the police had then told the media that two other suspected members of the outfit , Ahmed and Shakir , were at large . Their whereabouts is still not known . After Maqbools arrest , the police intimated their Hyderabad counterparts about his activities there . . . A police team from Hyderabad had come here to join the interrogation , said a senior police officer . Maqbool purportedly told the interrogators that he had conducted the reconnaissance in Hyderabad and had moved there to a rented accommodation about three months before he was arrested . . . Maqbool was allegedly roped into the module by Imran , who he met in jail while serving sentence in a Nizamabad murder case . According to the police , Imran introduced him to Riyaz and his brother Iqbal Bhatkal . . . The Delhi Police said Maqbool knew how to configure bombs and taught the same to the other members of the module that allegedly carried out Punes serial blasts to avenge the killing of suspected IM member Qateel Siddique in Punes Yerwada Jail by two other jail inmates on June 8 last year . . . The police further said Maqbool had learnt bomb-making from one Azam Ghori of Warangal , Andhra Pradesh , who was killed in a police encounter in 2000 . . . They were arrested four months ago by Delhi Police Special Cell in connection with last Augusts LOC_Event blasts . Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde made a flash visit to Hyderabad on Friday morning and saw for himself the damage caused by the twin bomb blasts in LOC_Event , the thickly populated area here , accompanied by Governor E. S. L. Narasimhan , Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and top officials of the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- , including its Director-General S.C. Sinha . . . Huge crowds that thronged the site jostled to break the police cordon to get a closer look of the leaders as they made an on-the-spot study of the dastardly bomb attacks . . . Mr Shinde later said an all-inclusive investigation into the serial bomb blasts was in progress and the persons who had masterminded the crime , would be identified and caught soon . We will leave no stone unturned to achieve immediate results on this front , he told reporters at Lakeview Guesthouse . . . The Home Minister flew in here by a special aircraft from Delhi and drove straight to the blood-stained blast sites which resembled a war-ravaged zone . A visibly upset Mr Shinde , who earlier had served as Andhra Pradesh Governor , also visited CARE Hospital at Nampally where most of the injured persons are being treated . He spoke with some of them , trying to get a first-hand account of how it all happened . . . No area-specific alerts . . He declined to divulge anything further about the incident on the ground that Parliament was in session . He said it was too early to blame any organisation or outfit , including the Indian Mujahideen , for the blasts . . . Mr Shinde categorically said his Ministry did not issue any area-specific alert to the Andhra Pradesh Government three to four days ago with a warning that incidents such as bomb blasts would occur , as being talked of . What was issued was a general alert to all the States , he said . . . He did not agree with the contention that the blasts were a result of intelligence failure . He did not confirm when asked if any source of phone-tapping was identified in this connection as alleged . . . He said the AP Government would bear the entire medical expenditure for treatment of the injured , besides the ex gratia already announced by it on ThursdayRs 6 lakh for the families of each of those killed and Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh to each of the injured persons . . . The blasts , he stated , claimed 14 lives so far , while the condition of six of the 119 injured persons was critical . The number of casualties could go up , he indicated . . . We will leave no stone unturned to achieve immediate results . Activists of CPI Chittoor town unit , led by its secretary Nagaraj , staged a dharna near Gandhi statue on LOC_Event on Friday condemning the bomb blasts on a busy road in LOC_Event on Thursday . Security has been stepped up across Tamil Nadu hours after the twin bomb blasts in LOC_Event on Thursday evening . The Standard Operating Procedure that includes intensified vehicle checks , security at vital installations and patrolling , was set in motion . . . According to police sources , police screened baggage of passengers at important railway stations . Security was strengthened at airports , major bus stands , malls and commercial streets . There is no specific threat perceived by intelligence agencies with regard to Tamil Nadu . However , heightened security arrangements are in place , a senior police official said . . . Police appealed to public to alert the control room or nearest police station if they came across any suspicious object or abandoned vehicle . LOC_Event , March 13 : Two mohalla cricketing sides had stepped into the field and were rolling out the mat when two unfamiliar , clean-shaven men carrying cricket kits walked towards them . . . For a moment , it appeared two cricket enthusiasts were looking to play on the Police Public School ground in LOC_Event , near a lifeline bypass connecting north and south Kashmir . . . The two men then dropped the kits , removed their jackets and reached into the bags . Out came from the kits AK-47 guns and from the jackets ammunition . . . By the time the guns fell silent after 30 minutes , five CRPF jawans and the two men lay dead and 10 persons , including three young players , were injured . . . It was a fidayeen attack , the first in LOC_Event in over three years and executed in a manner that makes every normal feature of civilian life a potential threat to the security forces . . . When the gunfire began , a CRPF reserve party was killing time on the lawns , several jawans playing cards . The premises were considered one of the safest in Kashmir because the school is sandwiched between a CRPF camp and police residential quarters . . . No child or teacher was in the school because of a shutdown called by separatists to seek the body of Afzal Guru , the Parliament attack convict who was hanged in New Delhi on February 16 . Several factors that swirled around the fidayeen attack today appeared to suggest Afzals execution has made Kashmir a deeper quagmire for the security forces . . . The CRPF reserve squad was awaiting deployment to quell the citys stone-throwing protesters , whose ranks have swelled afresh after the hanging of Afzal . . . The attack that began at 10.45 am came weeks after top militant groups vowed to avenge the execution of Afzal . . . The situation on the ground appeared so inflamed that some protesters threw stones at the security forces at Bemina , the site of todays fidayeen attack , even when the operation against the militants was in progress . . . Another target of the stones was a CRPF vehicle ferrying back from hospital jawans who donated blood for those injured in the attack . The CRPF opened fire and killed a youth , inflaming passions further . . . One of the players on the field said the militants lobbed grenades and fired indiscriminately at the CRPF jawans . The scenes that unfolded resembled signature television footage from urban conflict zones uniformed forces taking position , falling to the ground , rolling over , firing on the trot and screaming into what looked like mobile phones . . . The bodies of some jawans lay on the ground . The telltale sign of the end to the battle came when jawans carried out the bodies of the militants , one wearing a red outfit . . . All of us knelt and feared our end has come . The firing and explosions left us breathless for some time . For just 10 seconds or so the firing stopped and some of us ran to the fence , climbed it and crossed to the other side . I now realise it was madness because we could have been shot while climbing , he said , requesting not to be named . . . On record , the players all in the early twenties refused to acknowledge that they saw the militants , probably for fear of being targeted by the security forces . . . I just wanted to save myself and my friends on the ground . I did not see the militants entering the play ground . I lost my senses because of the firing , said Obaid , one of the injured youths . . . Mudassir Wani , who was also injured , said he did not realise he was injured possibly by splinters when he began running out of the field . . . We were busy laying the mat on the pitch and blasts and gunfire rang out . We fled the spot . Some people came to my rescue and shifted me to the hospital after I saw blood oozing from my foot , he said . . . New Delhi blamed militants based in Pakistan . The homegrown Hizb-ul Mujahideen later claimed responsibility , though police suspect the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba may be involved . A caller identifying himself as Baleeg-ud-din , the spokesperson for Hizb , told a local news agency its men had carried out the attack . . . A police officer claimed both fidayeen were Pakistanis . To be doubly sure , we are also verifying the reports whether one of the militants was Hilal Molvi ( a local militant commander ) . However , preliminary investigations reveal that both were Pakistanis , he said . . . Chief minister Omar Abdullah interrupted proceedings in the Assembly in Jammu to inform the House of the attack . This morning , two fidayeen attacked a CRPF camp at Bemina in which five CRPF men were martyred . Two militants were also killed , Omar said . . . The Valleys officiating police chief , Abdul Gani Mir , said the target of todays attack was peace , referring to the sharp decline in militant attacks in the state in recent years . . . Hundreds of police and paramilitary personnel rushed to the area to seal it and carry out search operations as the forces suspected that more militants might be hiding . . . The last fidayeen attack in LOC_Event was on January 6 , 2010 , when militants struck at the city centre . One policeman was killed and nine others were injured . LOC_Event : The three-year uneasy calm in LOC_Event was shattered on Wednesday with four fidayeen attackers crashing into a CRPF camp on the outskirts of the city , chucking bombs and spraying bullets on CRPF men , killing five of them . Two of the terrorists were killed in the gunbattle in LOC_Event near the CRPF camp , while the other two escaped . Police said 18 others , including security personnel and civilians , were injured . The four terrorists , around 23-24 years old , dressed in sports gear and carrying what appeared to be cricket kits , pulled out AK-47s , hand grenades and other ammunition just outside the Police Public School ground , near the CRPF camp , said police sources . They mingled with the boys in the ground before attacking CRPF jawans . The attack comes in the wake of monthlong violent protests and clashes in the Valley against the hanging of Afzal Guru , sentenced to death for the 2002 Parliament attack . In the wake of the hanging , Pakistan-based groups who had vowed revenge and Wednesday 's attack was seen as them making good their threat . The last fidayeen attack in LOC_Event city was in 2010 . Eyewitnesses said four assailants armed with weaponry surfaced at the gate of the CRPF camp , opened fire on the guards and then , entered the camp . A school by the side of the camp was luckily closed due to a general strike call by separatists in support of their demand for return of Afzal Guru 's body to his family . IG , LOC_Event , SM Sahai said the guards at the gate thought the terrorists were cricket players from the nearby playground . The militants removed their jackets , hurled several grenades and fired indiscriminately from their AK-47s . Sources believe that the other two fidayeen might have escaped from the camp . In New Delhi , union home secretary R K Singh told reporters , ` Prima facie evidence suggests that these -LRB- four -RRB- militants were from Pakistan . Two militants were killed , but two are missing . ' Chief Minister Omar Abdullah told the state assembly in LOC_Event that it was suicide attack . Around three hours after the attack , a group of CRPF men , on their way back from Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences -LRB- SKIMS -RRB- after donating blood for their injured colleagues opened fire at stone-pelting protesters in LOC_Event area of LOC_Event . The gunfire killed a 24-year-old man and injured his father , police said . An police statement said the vehicle ferrying the CRPF men on its return from the institute , ` came under the attack of stone pelting and other missiles by miscreants . ' The release said that the CRPF retaliated by firing on the protestors . Director SKIMS , Dr Showkat Hussain Zagar said the dead man had bullets in his chest . Hizbul Mujahideen , an indigenous terror group linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba and led by Pak-based Syed Salahuddin , claimed responsibility for the attack . A man claiming to represent HM called a LOC_Event news agency and warned of more such attacks . However , police officers said the attack bore tale-tell signs of a Lashkar operation . Three weeks back , the Punjabi Taliban , which works under Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , had written to TOI correspondent in Islamabad vowing that the next battlefield for all mujahideen will be the LOC_Event valley . ` The execution of Kasab and Afzal has aroused a new passion for jihad among the youth of this region . Angry mujahideen , after the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan , will search for a new battlefield . Surely their ultimate choice would be LOC_Event , ' said Maulana Asfatullah Muawiya . A separatist conglomerate Mutahida Majlis Mashawrat -LRB- MMM -RRB- also came into being after Guru 's hanging . ` It was a guerrilla mission carried out by a special squad formed for the said purpose , ' a Hizb spokesman who identified himself as Baleeguddin told a LOC_Event news agency on phone . After Guru 's hanging , LOC_Event authorities had handed over the law and order duties to Jammu and Kashmir police and removed CRPF from the streets . The Valley has been on boil since . Daily clashes , stone-pelting incidents , protests , strikes and violence jeopardized the normalcy restored by high turnout of tourists and a long period of relative peace .

He had been pulled out of his official vehicle and executed at point blank range , news channels reported . . . Congress members have declared three days of mourning and called for a bandh in the state . . . Background to attack : . . About 200 suspected Maoist rebels set off a land mine and opened fire on a convoy of cars carrying local leaders and supporters of Indias ruling Congress party in Chhattisgarh , killing at least 17 people and wounding 24 others , police said . . . Senior police officer M. Gupta said the attack occurred Saturday in the Sukma area , about 245 kilometers south of Raipur , the capital of Chhattisgarh state . . . The convoy was attacked in a forested area as the Congress members were returning to the state capital after attending a party rally , said Ram Niwas , a state police official . . . Two state party leaders and five police officers were among those killed , said RK Vij , another police officer . Other victims were party supporters . . . We are devastated , said Congress party President Sonia Gandhi , who denounced what she called a dastardly attack on the countrys democratic values . . . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the government would take firm action against the perpetrators . . . Police identified one of those killed as Mahendra Karma , a Congress leader in Chhattisgarh state who founded a local militia , the Salwa Judum , to combat the Maoist rebels . The anti-rebel militia had to be reined in after it was accused of atrocities against tribals indigenous people at the bottom of Indias rigid social ladder . . . The wounded Congress party members , among them 83-year-old Vidya Charan Shukla , a former federal minister , were taken to a local hospital , police said . . . The suspected rebels also took away a local party leader , Nand Kumar Patel , and his son , Vij said . . . The Press Trust of India news agency said the attackers blocked the road by felling trees . . . Vij said the suspected rebels triggered a land mine blast that blew up one of the cars in the convoy . The attackers then fired at the Congress party leaders and their supporters before fleeing . . . Police recovered 16 bodies from the scene , and 25 wounded people were hospitalized , Vij said . One of the wounded later died in the hospital , he said . . . The Congress party is the main opposition party in the state . It has stepped up political activities ahead of state elections scheduled to be held by December . . . The rebels , known as Naxalites , have been fighting the central government for more than four decades , demanding land and jobs for tenant farmers and the poor . They take their name from the West Bengal village of Naxalbari where the movement began in 1967 . The fighters were inspired by Chinese Communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have drawn support from displaced tribal populations opposed to corporate exploitation and official corruption . . . Prime Minister Singh has called the rebels Indias biggest internal security threat . They are now present in 20 of Indias 28 states and have thousands of fighters , according to the Home Ministry . . . In 2010 , Maoist rebels killed 27 paramilitary troops in an ambush in a dense forest in the Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh state . In fact , evidence indicates that rather than an attack to eliminate top Congress leaders , the Maoists ' target was only two PCC chief Nand Kumar Patel and Salwa Judum architect Mahendra Karma . All the others probably died in the crossfire , as Maoists later let the survivors go . They even gave water to some , including Konta MLA Kawasi Lakhma , and administered a painkiller injection to Congress leader Dr Shivnarain Dwivedi . . . Lakhma , who was in the same vehicle as Patel and his son Dinesh Patel -LRB- both of whom were killed -RRB- , corroborated this . As firing began , he , Patel , Dinesh and the four others in their vehicle hid in a roadside ditch . `` Some Maoists spotted us and asked us to surrender . I surrendered but did not reveal my identity ... They took us a little inside the forest and made us wait there for nearly two hours , '' he told The Indian Express . . . Around 6 pm , 90 minutes after the attack began , Maoists asked Lakhma and the others to leave , but took Patel and Dinesh away . `` As we turned back , we heard heavy fire ... I knew it was probably over , '' he said . . . An injured Lakhma was lucky to find a bike at the spot with the key in the ignition . Another survivor drove him to Darbha thana . . . The other target , Mahendra Karma , surrendered soon after his securitymen ran out of bullets . Eyewitnesses say he told the Maoists to let the others go as he was their only enemy . The rebels then took him away and beat him before killing him . `` We heard slogans , ` Mahendra Karma Murdabad ' , `` Lakhma said . . . Among those asked to leave by the Maoists soon after the attack began was Bastar Congress leader Lakheshwar Baghel . `` As firing began , we came out of our vehicles . They asked us to run away ... We walked for 30-40 km before reaching a village around 9 pm , '' he said . . . The tactic the Maoists employed was simple , and familiar . They first laid an ambush on the hilly , serpentine NH 221 , surrounded by thick forests , on the Bastar-Sukma border , then exploded an IED , creating a crater on the ground . As the vehicles slowed down , they opened indiscriminate fire . The massive explosion completely damaged the fourth vehicle in the convoy , a Bolero , with its pieces scattered across a large area . . . `` We tried to drive fast , but found little space . In the hurry , vehicles collided with each other and we were blocked ... could n't move backward or forward , '' said Ravi Kumar , one of the drivers . `` Some of our PSOs came out , took positions , but the Maoists had surrounded us . '' . . The firing continued for over 90 minutes , till the securitymen ran out of ammunition . `` We came out , hands on head . Maoists took us inside the forest , asked us to lie down , and asked us to leave after around 20 minutes , '' Kumar said . . . On Sunday noon , he was back at the spot , fixing his vehicle . . . While the state Congress 's charge of a `` conspiracy '' may be a bit misplaced , nobody is questioning the shocking security failure that made the Maoists ' task easy . Despite the important leaders that were a part of it , especially Karma , the Congress 's convoy on Saturday was travelling through this Naxal-dominated area with practically nil security . Contrast it with Chief Minister Raman Singh 's Vikas Yatra in the district , during which 3,000 cops were deployed at each rally point . . . Besides , while the Darbha thana and a major CRPF camp are just 10 km from the spot and police got the information about the attack within minutes , it took them nearly two hours to reach . A contingent left the thana immediately but claims they were `` prevented '' from proceeding by a Maoist blockade after a few kilometres . . . `` Maoists had blocked the road by felling trees , '' said a policeman who was part of the team . . . Bastar SP Mayank Srivastava said he had personally accompanied the contingent and they reached the spot by 6.15 pm . `` The attack had ended when we reached . We did not face any resistance , '' he said . . . The vehicle Shukla was in was in the middle of the convoy . On Sunday , behind the bullet-marked Land Cruiser lay a Hindi newspaper , among his other belongings . The front page carried a report on the recent Parivartan Yatra by the Congress in Bijapur attended by Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh . It carried the details of the Congress 's changing approach towards Maoists , with the headline : ` Goli ka jawab vikaas se denge -LRB- Will fight bullets with development -RRB- ' . . . In many ways , it summed up the story of the fight against Maoists today . Development remains elusive , bullets continue . Maoists on Saturday ambushed a Congress convoy in LOC_Event 's Darbha Valley , 350 km from capital Raipur , killing senior Congress leader Mahendra Karma and critically injuring former Union Minister V C Shukla . . . Former Chhattisgarh home minister Karma , the torchbearer of the controversial Salwa Judum ( a vigilante movement against Maoists that involved arming villagers ) , and former legislator Uday Mudliliyar were among the 24 people killed . . . Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will be travelling to Raipur . Gurgaon 's Medanta hospital has sent an air ambulance to the site to airlift the injured Shukla . . . Television media pictures show a Congress leader in critical condition following a Maoist ambush on a party convoy in LOC_Event 's Darbha Valley . . The police said the Maoists had kidnapped Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh , while a prominent woman tribal leader , Phulo Devi Netam , suffered injuries . . . Chhattisgarh , a hotbed of Maoist-waged violence , is set to go to polls later this year . The attack took place around 5.30 pm when the Congress convoy , comprising more than 20 cars and ferrying nearly 120 Congress leaders and workers , was on its way from the party 's ` Parivartan Rally ' in Sukma to Jagdalpur . . . While passing through a dense forest , about 50 km from their destination , the convoy found its path blocked by a tree that had been felled by Maoists . . . A group of around 150 rebels then triggered a blast and began indiscriminate fire . The personal security officers of the Congress leaders returned the fire but soon ran out of bullets becoming sitting ducks . . . Sources said Karma , who had earlier survived quite a few attempts on his life , was surrounded by at least 100 Maoists before he was killed . After carrying out the attack , the Maoists set nearby trees on fire . . . Ex-union minister V C Shukla was wounded in the attack . . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called up Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh soon after the attack to inquire about the ground situation . . . Senior home ministry officials convened for a high-level meeting following the attack and sources said additional forces have been rushed to Chhattisgarh . . . Sources added that the Central Reserve Police Force , responsible for anti-Maoist operations , was planning an onslaught to flush out the rebels from the jungles fearing more such attacks , with combing operations in the works too . . . UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi condemned the incident , terming it an attack on `` democratic values '' . . . Addressing the media after meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress vicepresident Rahul Gandhi , Sonia said : `` We are astounded and pained by what has happened . The Prime Minister has spoken to the chief minister . '' . . The BJP condemned the attack and said partisan concerns should not be allowed to hinder the fight against terror . . . NDA working chairperson and BJP veteran L K Advani called up the Prime Minister and asserted that concerted effort should be made to `` tackle Maoism and Naxalism with a heavy hand '' , a statement from his office said . BJP president Rajnath Singh echoed the sentiment . . . `` The fight against Naxalism and terrorism should be undertaken by all rising above partisan politics , '' he said . . . According to sources , Congress leaders in the state had been at the receiving end of threats from Maoists . . . `` There was intelligence that Congress leadership could be targeted in the LOC_Event region , '' a home ministry official said . . . Allegations flew thick following the attack , with a few Congress leaders accusing the ruling BJP government of failing to provide adequate security for the party 's pre-poll statewide campaign , which it has termed the ` Parivartan Yatra ' . . . `` Forces were deployed to ensure the safe progress of the BJP 's Vikas Yatra . We were not provided similar security , despite the state administration knowing full well about our scheduled yatra , '' former chief minister and Congress leader Ajit Jogi said . . . Union minister of State for Home RPN Singh will travel to Jagdalpur on Sunday as senior minister Sushilkumar Shinde is abroad on a trip . . Raipur : Congress leaders on Monday denied reports that the route of the ill-fated ` Parivartan Yatra ` , which came under Naxal attack on Saturday in south Bastar region , had been changed at the last moment . . . The convoy of Congress leaders was attacked at Jiram Valley in Darbha region when it was returning from Sukma to Jagdalpur . Twenty-seven people including Chhattisgarh Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel and veteran leader Mahendra Karma were killed and 37 others including former union minster VC Shukla were injured . . . Reacting to reports in local media about last-moment route change , former Chief Minister and Congress veteran Ajit Jogi said , ` Rally ` s route was not changed . MLA TS Singhdeo was in-charge of the route schedule and he had submitted the same route chart thrice for security approval . . . ` Convoy was proceeding according to its pre-decided schedule . This was a sheer security lapse , ' Jogi said . . . Dantewada MLA Kwawasi Lakhma , who was with Patel during the attack , too said there was no change of route . ` According to the plan we were moving to Keshlur in Darbha region via Tongpal . I was with Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh in the SUV . We were talking about the security arrangements . I told him that I had written to police for providing security on the Darbha route but there was no security , ' he added . NEW DELHI : A team of NIA officials has reached the deadly Naxal attack site in Chhattisgarh and began its probe to find out possible lapses on the part of the central forces or the state government , Times Now reported . Action will be taken if anyone is found guilty , minister of state for home RPN Singh told reporters in New Delhi on Monday . ` We have asked the NIA to investigate the Maoist attack . Security lapses could have taken place . Any lapse on the part of central forces or the state government , buck will have to be stopped somewhere . We have to take action , ' he said . Asked whether the mastermind of Saturday 's attack on Congress workers has been identified , Singh said it was too early to say that and any conclusion could be reached only when the probe is completed . The Centre has already deployed 30 battalion -LRB- approximately 30,000 personnel -RRB- in Chhattisgarh to help the state government carry out anti-Naxal operations . Earlier , Union home secretary R K Singh said an official order formally handing over the case to NIA to carry out the investigation would be issued soon . Home minister Sushilkumar Shinde had on Sunday said that NIA will probe the Maoist attack on Congress leaders and the Centre has received a go-ahead from Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh for it . Heavily-armed Maoists had on Saturday ambushed a convoy of Congress leaders in the state 's Bastar district , killing 27 people including PCC chief Patel , his son Dinesh , Congress leader Mahendra Karma and ex-MLA Uday Mudliyar and injuring 32 others , including former Union minister V C Shukla . Chhattisgarh is one of the worst Maoist violence-affected states and nearly 1900 lives have been lost in last eight years of which around 570 were civilians , 700 security personnel and the rest were Naxal cadres . MHA asks states to revamp security of political leaders In the wake of the attack on Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh , the Union home ministry on Monday asked all Maoists-hit states to revamp security of political workers and ensure that political activities are not affected by any violence . In an advisory to Naxal-hit states , the home ministry said security of political leaders both national and regional parties should be reviewed thoroughly and , if necessary , their protection should be upgraded . The Centre said there should not be any letup in the security of political leaders and whenever they travel or attend any function , adequate security should be provided . The home ministry has asked the states to ensure that activities of political parties should not be hampered by threat , intimidation or violence by Maoists . -LRB- With inputs from PTI -RRB- . Bhubaneshwar : At least 14 Maoists , including a woman , have been killed in a fierce encounter with police in LOC_Event 's LOC_Event district today , an official said.The gun battle , which lasted for several minutes , took place in a forest close to the border with Chhattisgarh . The Maoists who were killed are suspected to have been involved in the attack on a convoy of Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh in May this year.Today 's encounter was carried out jointly by a team of Special Operations Group -LRB- SOG -RRB- and District Voluntary Force -LRB- DVF -RRB- which raided the site and retaliated when the extremists fired at them . `` Fourteen Maoists were killed .

LOC_Event : Five people including two tourists were injured in a serial blast near Mahabodhi temple complex at LOC_Event 110 km from Patna on Sunday morning . According to Gaya police , the blasts took place in quick succession between 5.30 am and 6 am in the temple complex and near Mahabodhi tree . Senior police officers , including DIG of Magadh range , have reached the world heritage site Mahabodhi temple . Forensic experts from Patna too have rushed . Two Tibetan pilgrims who have been injured are admitted in AM College at Gaya , police said . CRPF personnel and fire tenders have been rushed to the spot . Mahabodhi temple had been on the hit list of the terrorists and IB had sent an alert last week . The temple was named a Unesco world heritage site in 2002 . It houses the holy bodhi tree as well as the giant Mahabodhi statue of Buddha , and multiple shrines marking the places where he is believed to have spent time after his enlightenment . After his meditations beneath the tree , Buddha is said to have devoted the rest of his life to teaching and he founded an order of monks before dying aged 80 . The LOC_Event temple complex in Bihar was rocked by a series of explosions on Sunday morning . Over a hundred worshippers had just finished 30 minutes of chanting and a few were entering the temple complex a UNESCO World Heritage site associated with the Buddhas enlightenment when the first blast occurred at 5:45 a.m. Nine explosions followed in the next hour four at temple sites and five in a 500-meter radius . . . The Special Task Force -LRB- STF -RRB- of the Kolkata Police is looking into whether a man held here late on Saturday evening and suspected to have links with the banned terrorist outfit , the Indian Mujahideen , is involved in the LOC_Event serial blasts . Anwar Hussain Mullick -LRB- 42 -RRB- was arrested from a bus stop in the heart of the city with explosives and fake Indian currency notes , senior officials of the STF said on Sunday . He is a resident of Chapra in West Bengals Nadia district bordering Bangladesh . He has been remanded in police custody till July 20 . . . Vilsagga -LRB- 30 -RRB- , a student monk from Myanmar who began his PhD in Buddhist Studies at Magadh University last month , and Tenzing Dorjee -LRB- 60 -RRB- , a retired soldier who now supervises the Ningma Tibetan monastery , were both praying near the LOC_Event and suffered serious injuries in a blast . A 3-kg cylinder with Trinitrotoluene -LRB- TNT -RRB- and ammonium nitrate was later recovered from under the sacred tree a peepal tree where the Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment in 6th century BC . The tree was not damaged though . The seven-story shikhar , a pyramidal structure that forms the main sanctum , as well as the other shrines at the site were intact . . . I had been meditating for ten minutes when there was a loud sound . My face and my hand hurt as I tried to make my way to the gate , Vilsagga spoke with difficulty as he lay in maroon robes in the Intensive Care Unit of the AN Magadha Medical College after being treated for soft-tissue injuries and splinter injuries on his face and arms . . . The police cordoned off the area as senior officials and politicians began arriving from LOC_Event , 12 kms away , and from Patna . The area will remain cordoned off till the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- team examines the area , said Director General of Police Bihar Abhayanand adding that the NIA team had difficulty in landing near LOC_Event because of bad weather . We have provided extra security as requested by the temple management committee and are examining the area for evidence , he added . All shops and most hotels remained closed . A group of monks lined up for evening prayers at 6 p.m. and were allowed inside the temple complex . . . Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached LOC_Event from Patna at 10:45 am in the morning and visited the temple complex as well as the injured being treated in Gaya . This is very unfortunate . We have requested the central government for the Central Industrial Security Force to be deployed as well as for help from the NIA in investigations , he said . . . Even as policemen , Central Reserve Police Force personnel , staff of Forensic Laboratory remained stationed at the complex , BJP workers staged demonstrations twice shouting slogans against the JD -LRB- U -RRB- government . The BJP called a bandh for Monday . At 6 p.m. , more than 50 BJP workers burnt an effigy of the Chief Minister Kumar near the temple . Congress workers criticised the BJP saying the party was using the incident to score politically . . . Senior police officials said that despite allegations by political parties , there was no intelligence failure on the part of the police . According to SP Narendra Kumar , there were 20 policemen and 38 guards of the LOC_Event Temple Management Committee posted at the main temple on Saturday . The southern wall of the temple complex is low and they may have used this wall to climb into the main complex between 3:30 -4 a.m. , said Mr. Kumar . NEW DELHI : The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- has claimed to have solved the July 7 LOC_Event blasts conspiracy with the recovery of a document from Ranchi that details the entire planning , including the placement of each of the 13 bombs and the planters associated with them . The NIA , which recovered 27 bombs from a lodge in Hindpidih area of Ranchi on Monday , also found a chart in the room that listed the men who allegedly planted 13 bombs in the temple complex of LOC_Event . The document shows that the blasts were planned by Indian Mujahideen 's Tehsin Akhtar and Haidar Ali and included the same planters as in the October 27 Patna blasts . It also includes the name of Imtiaz Ansari , arrested after one of the Patna bombs exploded at the city railway station . Ansari had denied any involvement in the LOC_Event blasts but had conceded that it had been planned by Tehsin . The chart 's matrix reveals Imtiaz had planted bombs near the LOC_Event in LOC_Event . His accomplice Ainul alias Tarique , who was injured while planting bombs at LOC_Event and later died , had planted bombs at the LOC_Event . Mujib , who was staying in the hotel room which was raided on Monday , had planted bombs in four places in LOC_Event . A senior officer privy to investigation details said , ` This shows that Imtiaz is still hiding several things about IM 's activities . With the recovery of these documents , the LOC_Event puzzle has been solved . We are now in the process of evidence collection and looking for the absconding accused . We will further interrogate Ansari . ' . Investigating agencies say they have evidence that the terrorist cell that bombed LOC_Event Chief Minister Narendra Modi 's rally in Patna last month also carried out Julys attack on the LOC_Event at LOC_Event . . . Sources in the National Investigation Agency told The Hindu they were basing their conclusion on documentary evidence found during a search at Iram Lodge in Ranchi , where the alleged perpetrators stayed before the attack . Key among the evidence , the sources said , was a hand-drawn map marking out locations where bombs were to be placed at LOC_Event , as well as code-names for the men carrying the explosive devices . . . The map tallies accurately with the LOC_Event attack , a senior NIA officer said . The NIA , he said , also recovered documents mapping the Gandhi Maidan in Patna , where Mr. Modis rally was being held when the bombs went off , as well as material on future options . . . Nine bombs were recovered from Iram Lodge at Hindpiri on November 4 . Two young men Mujibal Ansari and Salim Ansari had rented the room . Both went missing a week ago along with a suspect , Hyder Ali . . . Interestingly , the NIA had moved an application before a special court in New Delhi on October 25 seeking an arrest warrant against Ali , now named by investigators as a key member of the terror cell . The application was filed on the basis of a separate general investigation by the NIA against Indian Mujahideen members . GAYA : Terror struck the temple town of LOC_Event in LOC_Event , as nine serial explosions rocked the Mahabodhi Temple complex on Sunday morning . . . Two tourists , including a monk from Myanmar , have been injured in the blasts . The injured are being treated at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College hospital . . . Union home secretary Anil Goswami confirmed that the LOC_Event blasts were a terror attack . . . Bihar Police suspect the involvement of Indian Mujahideen in the temple blasts . . . According to Gaya Police , the blasts took place in quick succession between 5.30 am and 6am in the temple complex and near the Mahabodhi tree . One blast was reported from a bus stand . . . One of the blasts took place just under the enlightenment tree causing partial damage to the Buddha footprints in the shrine premises . . . Four blasts took place inside the shrine premises , while another three blasts took place in the LOC_Event . The Tregar monastery belongs to the Karmapa , the second most important spiritual leader . . . One blast each took place at the great Buddha statue and a bus parked on the Sujata bypass . . . Arvind Singh , a member of Mahabodhi Temple Management Commitee said two other bombs , one near the 80 feet statue and one at bus stand have been defused . . . Zonal IG Sushil Khopade confirmed eight blasts . . . LOC_Event chief minister Nitish Kumar reached LOC_Event to take stock of the situation . He took a round of the Mahabodhi Temple complex and held a meeting with the officials . . . BJP activists led by former minister Prem Kumar greeted Nitish Kumar with ` go back ' slogans outside the temple main gate . . . JD ( U ) workers present there raised pro-Nitish slogans and countered the protesting BJP workers . . . Cops have sealed the entry routes to the shrine . A NIA team is expected to arrive shortly for the probe . . . `` A team of NIA officers is coming to LOC_Event from Kolkata , '' DIG special branch Parasnath said . . . The DIG said , `` The sanctum sanctorum of the Mahabodhi Temple is intact . The temple premises have been sanitised . '' . . The secretary of the LOC_Event committee Dorji said , `` There were four blasts inside the temple premises . Fortunately , there was no damage to the Bodhi Tree or the main temple structure . '' . . `` In the first blast which took place near the Bodhi tree , a table was blown up because of which two persons were injured . The second blast , I think , was inside the enclosure where books were kept . The furniture was damaged but there was no damage to the monuments or statues , '' he said . . . Asked about the nature of explosives used , S K Bharadwaj , ADG ( Law and Order ) said they were low intensity time bombs . . . He said , `` We got information about six-seven months back that there may be a terror attack on the Mahabodhi temple . After that we had beefed up secuirty and deployed extra forces '' . . . LOC_Event Buddhist temple , around 10 km from LOC_Event and 100 km from capital Patna , is world famous . Lord Buddha had attained enlightenment here under the Mahabodhi tree in the temple premises . . . Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama makes frequent trips to LOC_Event and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had visited it six months back . A total of 52 countries have established their monasteries here . The Bihar Police failed to prevent Sunday 's serial blasts in and around LOC_Event 's LOC_Event , a World Heritage Site 115 km south of Patna , but the terrorists who planted a dozen improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) all over the complex were no better . Nine of the devices , described as low-intensity bombs , went off across the complex but the casualty list had only two injured on it.That 's because the blasts were triggered on a Sunday , a day when the complex has very few visitors and the LOC_Event in the complex has no classes . The terrorists apparently miscalculated . Today being Sunday , fewer believers were present . We are extremely lucky to have escaped with minor injuries to two devotees . The terrorists had planned to inflict maximum damage , said one senior police officer on condition of anonymity . The police are also examining why the terrorists used low intensity time bombs to trigger the blasts . The bombs were low-intensity but not crude , said an IPS officer.The three bombs that failed to explode at the Tergar Monastery classroom , Royal Residency hotel and 80-foot Buddha statue were later defused . The one that failed to explode at LOC_Event , home to 200 apprentice monks from Tibet , Nepal and the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh , Assam and Uttar Pradesh , is the reason behind minimum damage . The kids at LOC_Event wake up every morning at 5 am , and after a 30-minute prayer session settle down for classes by 6 am-when the first bomb placed behind the classroom wall went off . The blast damaged the window and classroom doors , besides breaking the glass panes but it did not cause any casualty because there were no classes being held . A second cylinder bomb placed there did not explode.ExplosivesThe three bombs that did not explode were later defused . The IEDs used in the blasts have been found to have consisted of a small gas container , an explosive detonator device and an analog clock used as a timer . Top police sources said they were sophisticated devices , and set to go off at 5:45 am , the time when most Buddhist believers begin prayers . The investigation , undertaken by multiple agencies right from the local police to the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) , is still in its initial stages as the police are yet to make any breakthrough . There are 16 closed circuit cameras installed in the LOC_Event complex ; all of them have captured images that investigators are now going over.Lax securityThe LOC_Event blasts have exposed the inadequacies of security system , both at the operational and management level . For instance , the metal detectors fitted at Mahabodhi LOC_Event are not calibrated , which render them ineffective and useless to detect explosives . The decision to let the Bodh Gaya Management Committee man security inside the premises is preposterous and immature , says one security expert . In October 2012 , Delhi police had arrested four Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) terrorists responsible for serial blasts in Pune on August 1 , 2012 . Subjected to sustained interrogation , the IM men revealed their game plan of attacking the LOC_Event in Bodh Gaya.The strike was being planned by suspect Syed Maqbool , who was arrested on leads obtained from the other three who were arrested earlier . Sources said the disclosures also revealed that top IM leaders-Imran Bhatkal and Riyaz Bhatkal-who are suspected to be in Pakistan gave the approval to attack Bodh Gaya sometime in July last year . But the plan was put on hold as the group planned a strike in Pune to avenge the mysterious killing of IM suspect Qateel Siddiquie in Pune 's Yerwada jail.In April 2013 , when the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) released a list of 12 IM terrorists and announced an award of Rs 10 lakh on each of them , it placed Gaya-born Amir Reza Khan alias Parvez alias Rizwan alias Muttaki , a permanent resident of Maheyan village in Mohanpur , LOC_Event , at sixth in the list.Reza , who is involved in blasts at LOC_Event and LOC_Event , is said to have provided pinpoint information about LOC_Event in LOC_Event . Specific Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) alerts on the LOC_Event were provided to the Bihar Police once last year and twice this year . Following these , Gaya Deputy Inspector General of Police Nayyar Hasnain Khan had held a security review meeting on July 3 with senior police and administrative officers , seeking better security at the temple . Within 100 hours , the terrorists triggered a series of blast that rocked the pilgrimage site . It also shook the confidence of the Nitish Kumar government , shaky as it is from its recent acrimonious breakup with the BJP.VengeanceSources said the attack in LOC_Event has happened days after Hafiz Saeed , chief of Pakistan 's Jamat-ud-Dawa , accused India of helping Myanmar in carrying out atrocities on Muslims in the country . LOC_Event has been on the terror radar over the last one year . Pakistan-based terror groups have been planning terror strikes in retaliation to the Myanmar violence , said a source.Last month the Intelligence Bureau gave specific information about two suspects entering LOC_Event to carry out a terror strike in the holy town . The suspects were identified as Sarful Rehman and Sahidur Rehman . Both belong to Bihar but have been living in Saudi Arabia and UK . . The Bodh Gaya temple complex in Bihar was rocked by a series of explosions on Sunday morning . Over a hundred worshippers had just finished 30 minutes of chanting and a few were entering the temple complex a UNESCO World Heritage site associated with the Buddhas enlightenment when the first blast occurred at 5:45 a.m. Nine explosions followed in the next hour four at temple sites and five in a 500-meter radius . . . The Special Task Force -LRB- STF -RRB- of the Kolkata Police is looking into whether a man held here late on Saturday evening and suspected to have links with the banned terrorist outfit , the Indian Mujahideen , is involved in the Bodh Gaya serial blasts . Anwar Hussain Mullick -LRB- 42 -RRB- was arrested from a bus stop in the heart of the city with explosives and fake Indian currency notes , senior officials of the STF said on Sunday . He is a resident of Chapra in West Bengals Nadia district bordering Bangladesh . He has been remanded in police custody till July 20 . . . Vilsagga -LRB- 30 -RRB- , a student monk from Myanmar who began his PhD in Buddhist Studies at Magadh University last month , and Tenzing Dorjee -LRB- 60 -RRB- , a retired soldier who now supervises the Ningma Tibetan monastery , were both praying near the Bodhi tree and suffered serious injuries in a blast . A 3-kg cylinder with Trinitrotoluene -LRB- TNT -RRB- and ammonium nitrate was later recovered from under the sacred tree a peepal tree where the Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment in 6th century BC . The tree was not damaged though . The seven-story shikhar , a pyramidal structure that forms the main sanctum , as well as the other shrines at the site were intact . . . I had been meditating for ten minutes when there was a loud sound . My face and my hand hurt as I tried to make my way to the gate , Vilsagga spoke with difficulty as he lay in maroon robes in the Intensive Care Unit of the AN Magadha Medical College after being treated for soft-tissue injuries and splinter injuries on his face and arms . . . The police cordoned off the area as senior officials and politicians began arriving from Gaya , 12 kms away , and from Patna . The area will remain cordoned off till the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- team examines the area , said Director General of Police LOC_Event Abhayanand adding that the NIA team had difficulty in landing near LOC_Event because of bad weather . We have provided extra security as requested by the temple management committee and are examining the area for evidence , he added . All shops and most hotels remained closed . A group of monks lined up for evening prayers at 6 p.m. and were allowed inside the temple complex . . . Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached LOC_Event from Patna at 10:45 am in the morning and visited the temple complex as well as the injured being treated in LOC_Event . This is very unfortunate . We have requested the central government for the Central Industrial Security Force to be deployed as well as for help from the NIA in investigations , he said . . . Even as policemen , Central Reserve Police Force personnel , staff of Forensic Laboratory remained stationed at the complex , BJP workers staged demonstrations twice shouting slogans against the JD -LRB- U -RRB- government . The BJP called a bandh for Monday . At 6 p.m. , more than 50 BJP workers burnt an effigy of the Chief Minister Kumar near the temple . Congress workers criticised the BJP saying the party was using the incident to score politically . . . Senior police officials said that despite allegations by political parties , there was no intelligence failure on the part of the police . According to SP Narendra Kumar , there were 20 policemen and 38 guards of the LOC_Event Temple Management Committee posted at the main temple on Saturday . The southern wall of the temple complex is low and they may have used this wall to climb into the main complex between 3:30 -4 a.m. , said Mr. Kumar . LOC_Event : Thirty six hours after multiple blasts rocked the LOC_Event temple , a heritage site in Bihar 's LOC_Event , it was re-opened to the public and special prayers for peace were held by hundreds of Buddhist monks . -LRB- Read : Latest developments -RRB- Investigators are , however , yet to get clear leads on who was behind the series of explosions on early Sunday morning , which left two monks injured . They are studying CCTV footage from about 15 cameras installed in the temple and released footage of an explosion near the LOC_Event . They have also detained a man called Vinod Mistry , whose identity card was found at the blasts site , and are questioning him . Mr Mistry has , however , reportedly claimed that he had lost his identity card a few days ago.There were 10 blasts at the temple and not nine as was earlier reported , Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shide said today . Three live bombs were found and were defused . An analysis of the bombs as allegedly revealed similarities between the Bodh Gaya explosions and the deadly blasts in LOC_Event in 2008 and LOC_Event in 2012 , in which the police suspect the hand of terror group Indian Mujahideen . But investigators warn that more evidence is needed before drawing conclusions.Clocks were used to trigger the blasts yesterday and all bombs were timed to explode at 5.30 am . The investigators are trying to work out why that time was chosen as activity inside the temple is minimal then . The unexploded bombs had Urdu markings on them.The bombs were strategically placed , one was even planted at a height of 20 feet on a Buddha statue , for which a ladder would have been needed , the police said . But no one saw a ladder being brought into the temple premises . -LRB- Read -RRB- Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , criticised for not having secured the temple adequately despite an intelligence report in October last year that it could be attacked , has requested the Centre to take over security at the heritage site . `` We are requesting the central government to give the responsibility of the security arrangements of the temple to the Central Industrial Security Force or CISF '' , Mr Kumar said . -LRB- Read : Politics over blasts - It 's BJP vs Nitish , Digvijaya -RRB- Mr Kumar accused the BJP , which was a partner in his government till last month , and rival Lalu Prasad 's RJD of colluding to politicise the Bodh Gaya blasts . The two parties had called for a bandh or shut down in the region . . At least two monks , a Burmese and a Tibetan , were injured in a coordinated terror attack , in and around the Mahabodhi Temple ( the Temple of the Great Awakening , where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment ) Complex at Bodh Gaya in the Gaya district of Bihar on July 7 , 2013 . The Bihar Police has confirmed that ten low-intensity serial blasts occurred between 5:30 and 5:58 am at and around the World Heritage site . Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde confirmed , `` Today I have the information of 10 blasts . A total of 13 bombs were placed there Two persons have been injured 50 year old Dorji and Bala Sanga ( 30 ) . '' Two live bombs were detected and defused at the Complex , while a third bomb was recovered near the Royal Residence hotel at Baiju Bigaha village , about four kilometres from the LOC_Event . The Bihar Police on Monday released the CCTV footage of serial blasts at LOC_Event on Sunday . No group has so far accepted responsibility for the attacks.One person was detained on Monday by the NIA in connection with the serial blasts at the LOC_Event in which two monks were injured.DIG , Magadh Range , Nayyer Hasnain Khan said an identity card was found within the temple premises on Sunday on the basis of which the person was detained.The NIA , Khan said , was interrogating him.One suspect hailing from Barachatti block in LOC_Event has been detained and we are questioning him . We have been analysing the footage and based on that some more people would be questioned soon , a senior police official said . The Bihar police also released sketches of two suspects in teh serial terror blasts at Bodhgaya . The suspects have been identified as Sahidur Rehman and Saifur Rehman , both M operatives . Headlines Today has learnt that the IB was on the lookout for the two , who allegedly slipped into Bihar last month . Sahidur and Saifur Rehman are brothers . One lives in Scotland and the other in Saudi Arabia . Sahidur arrived in India on 6th May while Saifur came a month later . According to IB reports , the two were initially plotting to attack LOC_Event but shifted the target to Bodhgaya later . On Sunday , the Kolkata Police had arrested suspected Indian Mujahideen member , Anwar Hussain Mullick after he was found carrying Rs 1.9 lakh fake currency . The National Security Guard ( NSG ) team has reached LOC_Event to investigate the blasts . No outfit has taken responsibility for the attacks at LOC_Event yet . But Headlines Today has learnt that investigators are focusing on primarily 3 theories.First is the , the Al Qaeda angle . A little known Burmese Outfit named Jamatal Tahawid Jihad is suspected to have carried out blasts with the help of Al Qaeda operatives.The home ministry though has ruled out this possiblity for now.Second theory points towards the Indian Mujahideen . Delhi police had given a tip off to Bihar police after one IM operative Sayeed Maqbool confessed to the plot of carrying out serial blasts at LOC_Event finally , there is the revenge attack angle . Serial balsts in LOC_Event could have been a reaction to the persecution of Muslim minorities in Buddhist majority Myanmar . Experts also believe that Buddhists were the main target of Sunday 's attacks . - with PTI inputs . NEW DELHI : The NIA has zeroed in on the shop in Guwahati that sold exactly 13 ` Lotus ' brand clocks to a man ahead of LOC_Event blasts - same as the number of bombs planted in temple complex . Each of these clocks was used as a timer in the bombs . The investigators have also traced the cylinders to Meerut , and believe that the ` poor quality ' cylinders were manufactured by an unregistered facility there . However , they were possibly bought in Bihar itself , where they are transported by the Meerut plant for sales . The NIA investigators have confirmed from the Rajkot-based manufacturer of ` Lotus ' brand clocks that it had recently sent a sales consignment of 300 clocks to Assam . Interestingly , a shopkeeper in Guwahati also revealed that a man had bought 13 of these clocks in a single transaction . The investigators are now trying to establish the identity of this buyer . Two monks were injured in ten blasts that took place early in the morning of July 7 in LOC_Event . Three unexploded bombs were found . The temple and the Bodhi Tree , under which Lord Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment , did not suffer any damage in the blasts which shook the holy town frequented by Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka , Myanmar , China , Japan and the whole of south east Asia .

Earlier , the Bihar Police released the CCTV footage of one of the blasts . They have also detained a man named Vinod Mistry , whose identity card was found at the blast site , for questioning . Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said he will ask the Centre to appoint the Central Industrial Security Forces -LRB- CISF -RRB- to guard the world-famous temple . The Delhi Police Special Cell had , on the basis of revelations made by alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorist Sayed Maqbool , last October disclosed that the banned outfit planned to target the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya . The police had shared the input with the agencies concerned almost nine months ago . . . Through an October 26 , 2012 release , the Special Cell announced Maqbools arrest in the Pune blasts case . It said he was a trainer in improvised explosive devices . He was tracked down to Hyderabad where he was arrested on October 23 last year . . . Based on the purported disclosures of other suspected IM members Asad Khan , Imran Khan , Sayed Feroz and Landge Irfan Mustafa the police had said the four , along with Maqbool , had planned to carry out a fidayeen attack at the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya in retaliation to the alleged atrocities being committed on Muslims in Myanmar . Their plan had the approval and support of Bhatkal brothers -LSB- alleged IM founders -RSB- . . . Pune blasts . . The Special Cell said Maqbool had taught Imran and Asad how to configure a bomb . In April 2012 , Imran introduced him to the Bhatkal brothers . Before the Pune serial blasts in August last , Maqbool , Irfan , Imran and Asad discussed their plan to target the Buddhist shrines in LOC_Event , said the release , adding that since the Bhatkals wanted to avenge the death of Qateel Siddiqui -LRB- a terror suspect killed in Punes Yerawada Jail -RRB- , they decided to first carry out blasts in Pune . . . The police said Maqbool last year helped Imran in conducting a reconnaissance of Dilkushnagar , Begum Bazar and Abids in Hyderabad on a motorcycle . Incidentally , two blasts were triggered that claimed 18 lives in Dilkushnagar on February 21 . No arrests have been made in the case so far . Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , who visited the LOC_Event condemned the attack but maintained that security had been provided to the religious site . Any condemnation of this incident would not be enough . LOC_Event is a sacred pilgrimage site and the key location for the faith of millions across the world . To carry out such an attack at such a place in condemnable , he said . The government had always been on the alert and taken steps to ensure the security of the LOC_Event and LOC_Event in general . . . RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav held the government responsible for failing to act upon intelligence inputs . . . LJP leader Ramvilas Paswan demanded Mr. Kumars resignation on moral grounds for failing to prevent the attack despite intelligence inputs . Despite multiple meetings by the police and the administration and intelligence inputs it was regrettable that nearly eight blasts rocked the LOC_Event in Bihars Gaya district . The explosions injured two persons , including a Burmese monk , Pragya Deep , Treasurer of the All India Bhiku Sangha told The Hindu on the phone from Bodh Gaya . . . The administration had prior information . There was a report of the Intelligence Bureau . A series of security review meetings have been conducted . There have been at least five to six meetings . Its shameful that despite this , the blasts have taken place . This is a mistake on the part of the administration , Pragya Deep said . . . He was conducting a meeting in the Sanghas office , about 10 minutes from the LOC_Event , when he heard sounds of the blast . . . We immediately left for the temple , where we were informed by the monks there of the serial explosions . The explosions began around 5.15 a.m. and lasted for half an hour , he said . . . The first blast took place on the left of the sacred LOC_Event where the Buddhas footprints are located . The second blast site was the LOC_Event where the bomb was kept in an ambulance located outside . The third explosion was outside the LOC_Event , one of the places associated with enlightenment of Lord Buddha . The Buddha is believed to have stood here for seven days looking at the LOC_Event , Pragya Deep said . . . The next blast was near a wall railing that is the entry point for the monks . This could have been intended to cause loss of life , but thankfully not many people were there around that time . . . One Burmese monk Vishwavidya was injured in this blast . He sustained injuries in the leg , hand , head and chest . He is being treated at the local government hospital . A staff member of the Nirmal Temple was also injured in the explosion . Both of them are out of danger , Pragya Deep said . . . The next three bombs went off in a car outside the Karma Temple . A final blast was near the famous LOC_Event . Two bombs were kept near the statue . One went off while one which was placed near the feet did not explode . Had it gone off , the damage would have been great , Pragya Deep said . . . There is a sense of fear among the monks at the temple . Its natural to feel fear . I dont know why the temple was made the target . We were never involved in any kind of violence . Neither is there any ongoing religious conflict involving the Buddhist community , Pragya Deep said . 23:49 pm : Blasts in LOC_Event ' a cowardly act ' , says Sonia GandhiCondemning the serial blasts at LOC_Event in Bihar as a ` cowardly ' act , Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Sunday expressed hope that the guilty will be brought to book at the earliest.Gandhi said the attack on the sanctum sanctorum of peace was unfortunate .21:29 pm : Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemns terror attack Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the terror attack in internationally renowned LOC_Event in Bihar , a place of religious significance for the Buddhists .20:26 pm : Bihar Police release sketches of two men suspected to be behind serial blasts .20:09 pm : NIA team reaches LOC_Event , begins probeA National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) team began its probe into the serial blasts in the LOC_Event in Bihar 's LOC_Event town , police officials said.A NIA team led by an IPS officer Vikas Vaibhav began probe into the serial blasts in LOC_Event soon after they arrived , said an official at police headquarters .19:45 pm : Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama condemns LOC_Event blasts .18:55 pm : Suspected Indian Mujahideen member held in Kolkata for LOC_Event bomb blastsPolice are probing links of a man arrested with explosives to the banned terrorist outfit Indian Mujahideen , suspected to be involved in LOC_Event bomb blasts , officials said.Anwar Hussain Mullick , 42 , was arrested from a bus stop in the heart of the city late on Saturday evening with explosives and fake Indian currency notes , a senior official of the Special Task Force said here Sunday .18:41 pm : Gujarat on alert after LOC_Event serial blasts : DGPAn alert has been sounded across Gujarat in the wake of the serial blasts that rocked LOC_Event in Bihar 's LOC_Event district , Gujarat Director General of Police ( DGP ) Amitabh Pathak said .18:38 pm : Bomb found in LOC_Event hotel defusedThe cylinder bomb found at hotel in LOC_Event village has defused .

Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde said the LOC_Event serial blasts case has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- after the Nitish Kumar government made a request in this regard . Patna 's Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences -LRB- IGIMS -RRB- Director Arun Kumar Singh told PTI that Tarique is on life support system . Tarique has splinters in his brain and there is little chance of his survival , he said .

Jharkand DGP Rajeev Kumar yesterday told reporters in Hazaribagh that six persons were detained for interrogation in connection with the serial blasts set off in and around the Gandhi Maidan ahead of the rally addressed later by BJP 's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi .

Acting on a tip-off by the Patna Police and the NIA , the local police yesterday picked up Ahmad from Alauli village and handed him over to an investigation team from Patna , the Superintendent of Police -LRB- SP -RRB- Vinay Kumar said . Ahmad , said to be an associate of the serial blasts ' prime accused Imtiyaz Ansari , an alleged Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- operative , was then taken to the state capital by a Patna police team for questioning , Patna 's Superintendent of Police -LRB- SP -RRB- , City , Jayant Kant said . The suspect was presently in NIA 's custody and being interrogated about his alleged role in the serial blasts , he said .

Of the 83 people injured , two are in a critical condition . . . A total of seven blasts took place of which five were inside the LOC_Event and two at the station , Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj told The Hindu . . . One of the blasts at the station occurred even as the bomb disposal squad was defusing a bomb . The police found two unexploded improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- at two locations around the maidan . Searches are on for more IEDs . . . The blasts claimed the lives of Ram Narayan Singh , Vikas Singh , Munna Srivastav and two others . . . The first blast occurred at 9.30 a.m. in the toilet on Platform 10 at the Patna junction . One critically injured person , admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna , is believed to be a suspect . . .

The second blast took place at 1 p.m. I could escape with a fractured finger . The bomb I was defusing had a timer attached to it . So it could not have been a crude bomb , he said . . .

However , he denied political conspiracy . At a press conference , he condemned the incident and denied any security lapse by the police or the administration . The attacks were carried out with an intention to vitiate the atmosphere in Bihar . They took us completely by surprise . We had no intelligence input or alert either from the Centre or State agencies . It would be wrong and an over simplification to call this a security lapse . Such a thing has never happened in Bihar , Mr. Kumar said . . . Bihar has not had a history of confrontation . This is the handiwork of people who want to spoil Bihars climate . We wont let them succeed in their designs . , he said . . . He announced an ex gratia of Rs .5 lakh for the families of the deceased .

BARIDHANESH -LRB- GOPALGANJ -RRB- : BJP 's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi 's helicopter could not land due to dense fog and bad weather at sleepy village Baridhanesh under Hathua police station in Gopalganj district on Saturday .

At least five people were killed and more than 70 injured as seven bombs exploded here Sunday , six of them in and around the ground where BJP star Narendra Modi addressed a rally hours later . . . The first of the supposedly low intensity blasts ripped through a toilet at around 10 a.m. at the newly built Platform 10 of the railway station in the heart of the city , killing one person and wounding another . . . After an hour , by which time Modi had reached LOC_Event but not the rally ground , four explosions took place inside the LOC_Event , killing four others and causing a lot of panic , police and witnesses said . . . The Patna railway station is located two-three kilometres from the LOC_Event . . . As smoke billowed at the blast sites , people ran in different directions . Witnesses reported seeing some of the rallyists falling on the ground , bleeding and in pain . . . Two more bombs went off just outside the LOC_Event , one near a cinema hall and another close to the Twin Tower building complex . But no one died in these two places . . . LOC_Event 's Director General of Police Abhayanand confirmed the five deaths and said all the victims succumbed to their multiple injuries at the Patna Medical College and Hospital . . . A doctor at the hospital said eight of the injured were in `` very critical condition '' . . . The blasts at the LOC_Event , where Modi later addressed a huge rally of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters , took place even as second rung party leaders were addressing the crowds ahead of Modi 's arrival . . .

Later , Modi said the bomb attacks were `` deeply saddening '' . He appealed for peace and calm . . .

Nitish Kumar cancelled a trip to Munger district and asked the chief secretary and the police chief to submit a report at the earliest . . . . PATNA/NEW DELHI : The political campaign for the 2014 election took a frightening turn on Sunday when six persons were killed and around 100 injured at the crowded venue of Narendra Modi 's rally here in a suspected terror attack designed to inflict mass casualties . Eight explosive devices with timers went off between 9.30 am and 12.25 pm as part of a serial bomb attack suspected to be the handiwork of Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- . Four alleged operatives of the outfit have been detained , one of whom is in critical condition after being caught in a blast . During interrogation , they reportedly told the police that they had staged the attack in retaliation for the Muzaffarnagar riots . They are also said to have named the IM module involved in the Bodh Gaya blasts . The names of the four detained are Imtiaz Ansari , Ainul , Akhtar and Kaleem . Ansari , a resident of Ranchi , was apprehended at the railway station just after the first two bombs went off . He was apparently planning to plant some more bombs but panicked when he saw the police and bomb disposal squad . On being challenged , he tried to flee but was arrested . The investigators then got incredibly lucky . Ansari had been asked by his handlers not to carry a mobile phone . So he had jotted down phone numbers of a dozen conspirators on a piece of paper , which fell into the hands of the cops and helped them track down some of the others . One of them , Ainul , who is critical , was initially believed to be a victim of the railway station blasts before it emerged that he was also part of the conspiracy . Six of the bombs went off inside and near LOC_Event , the sprawling rally venue . The remaining two blasts took place inside a public convenience complex at LOC_Event when trains , including special ones hired by the BJP , were disgorging rallyists . The police officially said there was only one blast inside the railway station , but sources insisted there were two . A bigger tragedy was averted only because the fortitude of the massive crowd ensured that there was no stampede : a horrific prospect that could have killed hundreds . Modi and other BJP leaders helped . The Gujarat CM , who defied the advice of Gujarat Police to address the Hunkar rally , as well as other BJP leaders made no mention of the outrage in their speeches , with the crowds taking the exploding improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- in their midst for firecrackers . Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley apparently favoured going ahead with the rally without mentioning the blast as they feared that calling it off would have led to panic and a stampede . The Hindutva leader , who spoke for less than an hour after the last explosion at LOC_Event , ended his speech by exhorting the audience to maintain peace and unity at all costs . ` There should be no stain on LOC_Event 's reputation and peace must be maintained across the country , ' he said . Reports from Ranchi said the Jharkhand police also detained two suspected IM operatives in this connection and seized explosives and a picture of Osama bin Laden from their possession . Talking to reporters , LOC_Event CM Nitish Kumar confirmed that documents found on Ansari had given the investigators important leads . Kumar , who was attacked by the BJP for not providing security at the rally venue , said police were working on the basis of telephone numbers Ansari was carrying , and claimed that the case would be worked out shortly . According to sources , Ansari and other members of the gang had ringed the venue with explosives in the morning when the participants had already started congregating . The explosives were planted in a clockwise manner , starting with a spot bang across the Police Control Room . Sources quoted Ansari as telling his interrogators that the IM module took care not to plant the explosives in the night , fearing that dew would dampen the IEDs which were said to be similar to those used in the Bodh Gaya blasts . Talking to reporters , the LOC_Event CM and his DGP Abhayanand were at pains to stress that there were no lapses on the government 's part . Kumar said the rally organizers were extended all assistance sought by them , adding that BJP had expressed no apprehension of a terror attack . The police chief also claimed that standard operating procedures laid down for the purpose were scrupulously followed . However , BJP leaders accused them of laxity and indifference , saying that even elementary precaution setting up adequate number of frisking points and anti-sabotage checks was not taken . Also , while the LOC_Event CM claimed that there was no intelligence alert , sources in the police said that IB had warned them about a possible terror attack on the rally . The multiple jimmy-jib cameras for an aerial view of the surging crowds . The fast camera movements copied from MTV shows . The steady cameras to track people on the stage . The professional event management firm for set design and hi-tech acoustics . The massive translites and gigantic LED screens.The stage seemed set more for a rock concert by the reigning superstar . But this was no music festival . This was BJP 's PM candidate Narendra Modi 's first rally in Bihar . And what a debut it was.Patna 's historic Gandhi Maidan was packed to the brim with enthusiastic supporters who had travelled many hours from different parts of the state.They had come in especially-arranged trains and buses and had walked many miles to reach the Gandhi Maidan . Many had made their own arrangements to come and listen to a man who had so far been denied the opportunity to enter Bihar by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.The venue started filling up from the wee hours of the morning and by the time the Gujarat Chief Minister arrived around 1 pm , there was not an inch of free space.People had climbed onto roofs and terraces of high rise buildings adjoining the venue . They had even jumped onto Mahatma Gandhi 's statue at the entrance of the ground.Every corner was taken . And as Modi was walking up the stage , an enthusiastic horde crashed through the barricades and entered the media enclosure and the VIP area . Chants of Modi , Modi filled the air , quite like the chants that rally for Sachin at the Wankhade Stadium.The crowd latched onto every word Modi spoke , quite like cricket fans would delight at every stroke Sachin played.There were multiple blasts near the venue of the rally just before Modi started speaking.At first they sounded like Diwali crackers being set off by enthusiastic supporters . But as news trickled in of casualties , tension gripped the air.Local BJP leaders came on the microphone and tried to downplay the explosions and dismissed them as tyre blasts and firecrackers.The crowds were convinced that this was a conspiracy to ruin Modi 's rally.On any other occasion , there would have been a mad scramble to get out of the venue and a stampede would have been highly likely.But despite the blasts , which saw dozens of injured being rushed to nearby hospitals , the crowds did n't move from their place.No mischief-maker was going to come between the crowds and Modi today.For the man himself , this rally was special . He had a point to prove . So far , coalition dharma had forced him to lie low and not respond to Nitish Kumar 's constant barbs against him.But today , there was no alliance compulsion to hold him back . And Modi let loose.He started off in Bhojpuri , and a delighted crowd responded with wah-wah . He spoke of Bihari pride and how the state government had failed to create jobs and was forcing Biharis to travel to Gujarat and elsewhere in search of employment.But the main target of Modi 's speech was Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , a leader he derisively referred to as his friend.Modi called Nitish and opportunist and hollered : People ask me why my friend left the BJP . I tell them those who can stab their guru Jai Prakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia in the back can easily leave their long-time friend BJP . We sacrificed the chance of Sushil Kumar Modi becoming the chief minister in favour of my friend ( Nitish Kumar ) for the sake of clearing the ` Jungle Raj ' in Bihar . Nitish did n't betray the BJP . He betrayed the people of Bihar . I want to ask you , will you punish those people who betrayed you?This was BJP 's PM candidate Narendra Modi 's first rally in Bihar.For the first time at a public rally , Modi highlighted his roots as a chaiwallah selling tea at a railway platform during his early days in Gujarat.In a deeply casteist society , Modi tried to play up his credentials as a backward leader who understood the pain of the impoverished , unlike Rahul Gandhi , who was to the manor born.Congress leaders do n't know what poverty and hunger are . I used to sell tea on trains . I know how difficult it is to get onto trains and make a living . Even the railway minister does n't have my experience of the problems one faces on trains.Modi also tried to reach out to the Muslims of Bihar and promised them development.Our Muslim brothers in Bihar are so backward . In Gujarat , one of the fastest developing regions is Muslim-dominated . Let Hindus and Muslims together and work towards ending poverty . Our religion is India first . We have to maintain peace and harmony at any cost.However , the BJP 's attempts to attract Muslims in large numbers to the rally did not materialise.Most people who came in trains , even from Muslim dominated areas like Kishanganj , were Hindus.Muslim presence at the Gandhi Maidan was minimal.Gandhi Maidan has seen massive rallies in the past . The historic rally of Jai Prakash Narain in 1974 , in which he gave the war cry for ` Sampoorna Kranti ' against the Indira Gandhi government , was held here.Also , Lalu Prasad 's mega Garib Raila of 1995 , which is supposed to have attracted a crowd of more than four lakh people , at a time when the RJD chief 's popularity was at its peak in Bihar.The BJP is claiming that the Hunkar Rally on Sunday smashed all previous attendance records.Estimates vary wildly . By conservative estimates there were about 3 lakh people at the rally . The more exuberant among the BJP leaders say more than 10 lakh people attended.The real number may lie somewhere in between . But make no mistake , Modi sent a strong message from Gandhi Maidan.No other leader in Bihar today is capable of attracting such a big crowd to a rally.Most , in fact , avoid the maidan to hide their inability to fill up the ground.Most of the people who attended Sunday 's rally were youngsters . Many were first time voters , who seemed more attracted to the aura of Modi than they were to the policies of the BJP.Whether Modi can live up to the expectations that he seems to have built up is not known . But the youngsters who gathered at the Gandhi Maidan seem to believe that the BJP leader has a magic wand with which he can cure India of its ills.They have heard of the Gujarat development model and they think Modi can turn Bihar into a land of milk and honey.Modi wanted a show of strength and he achieved that goal.But the real test is to see if Modi can convert the surging crowds at the rally into voters during the general elections . .

A crude bomb explosion in LOC_Event . One person was injured and admitted to Patna Medical College . Two more crude bombs were found . . . OneIndia News . . . PATNA/NEW DELHI : Tehsin Akhtar alias Monu , Indian Mujahideen 's new commander , masterminded the bomb attack on Narendra Modi 's crowded rally to kill women and children in large numbers by setting off a stampede , and was present at LOC_Event to supervise the bombers as they ringed the rally ground with explosives . This was revealed by IM operative Imtiaz Ansari who was fortuitously arrested with explosives and has since provided vital leads on the bombers and the terror plot . ` Hamara uddeshya tha aatank faile aur bhag daur main kafi sankhya mein mahilayen aur bachche maren -LRB- Our objective was to trigger fear so that many women and children get killed in the resultant rush -RRB- , ' Imtiaz was quoted as saying in the FIR registered by Patna Police . ` Muzaffarnagar mein bahut Muslim maare gaye hain , aur tum sirf namaz hi padhte raho -LRB- Many Muslims got killed in Muzaffarnagar and all that you people do is to offer namaz -RRB- , ' Tehsin exhorted his associates , according to Imtiaz . This was noted in the FIR . The incendiary exhortation of Tehsin , who used the alias of Memon for the Patna attack , had the desired effect with Imtiaz and others getting motivated to carry out a spectacular attack . ` Yeh sun kar yeh bhi uttejit hue aur koi bada kaam karne ka tay hua , ' the FIR said . Sources also quoted Imtiaz acknowledging the involvement of Tehsin , a resident of Samastipur district in Bihar , in the serial bomb blasts on Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya in July : a terror attack scripted in retaliation against the alleged killings of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar . Besides Imtiaz 's statement , Tehsin 's involvement in LOC_Event attack is indicated also by the use of the same brand of clocks , Lotus , which is manufactured at Morvi in Gujarat 's Rajkot district , in both the serial blasts . Sources in Bihar Police confirmed to TOI that Tehsin , who is wanted for multiple terror blasts , was recently spotted in the state , adding that a massive manhunt has been launched for the fugitive jihadi . ` His photographs have been circulated among authorities in districts and posts of the Shashatra Seema Bal , the paramilitary force which guards the border with Nepal , ' a source said . In its FIR , Patna Police identified other members of the group as Tariq alias Ainul who suffered life-threatening injuries while planting bombs at the railway station , Taufiq , Nauman and Hyder alias Abdullah . It cited Imtiaz 's testimony to say that Tehsin started instigating the group to carry out the serial blasts since Monday . The group split into three batches of two each , and took different buses of Priyanshu Travels to reach Patna on the morning of Sunday when the rally was scheduled . Imtiaz and Tariq were to plant bombs at the railway station to strike those arriving for the rally , before reuniting with the others at LOC_Event . However , one of the IEDs exploded when Tariq was planting them . The explosion brought many policemen to the station and one of the constables nabbed Imtiaz when he was trying to escape . Imtiaz 's interrogation helped police establish the identity of others involved in the attack , including Tehsin , who is wanted for the 2011 triple blasts in Mumbai , Pune blasts in 2012 and LOC_Event blasts in 2013 and appears to have taken over the leadership of IM after the arrest of Yasin Bhatkal in August . Yasin 's arrest and the details he provided about his accomplices should have led cops to Tehsin and another IM terrorist , Pakistani national Waqas , from their hideout in Mangalore . However , after the arrest started playing on TV news , the two abandoned their Mangalore flat leaving behind several bomb-making material . A leading member of IM 's Darbhanga module , he has set up a network which stretches from Darbhanga , Madhubani , Sitamarhi and Samastipur in northern Bihar to Aurangabad and Gaya in central Bihar . The emerging leads in the serial blasts during Modis Hunkar rally in Patna are surely disturbing for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar . Preliminary investigations point to a conspiracy hatched in Ranchi , but the handiwork of the Darbhanga module of the Indian Mujahideen . The alleged mastermind , Tehseem Akhtar alias Monu , belongs to an area bordering Samastipur-Darbhanga and has been one of the key associates of IM kingpin Yasin Bhatkal who was arrested this August . . . One of the two arrested suspects Imtiaz Ansari ( the other , Ainul , succumbed to injuries that he had got while planting the bombs ) reportedly identified Tehseems photo when it was shown to him by intelligence and security officials . . . A file photograph of Modi . PTI . . The serial blasts raise far more serious questions on what kind of turn this gives to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections . The political atmosphere is already charged and bitter , it is now bloodied . If this is not cracked now then as electioneering gets more heated , there could be a possibility of further strikes and consequent violence , possibly social tension . The suspected involvement of the IM adds a terror angle to the existing Naxal violence and their continued inclination to influence the voting pattern in Bihar . . . There is also a great deal of talk in political and bureaucratic circles over the way the two leaders , Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar , reacted to the situation on Sunday . By the time Modi landed at Patna airport at12 .15 pm , three blasts had taken place . The IB informed the accompanying Gujarat police and NSG officers of the incident and thereafter Modi was duly informed of it by the IB station head in Patna , incidentally a Gujarat cadre IPS Vivek Shrivastava . . . Modi was told of the kind of threat perception he had and was requested to drop the idea of addressing the rally . Modi remained unmoved and after a quick discussion with Gujarat police officers he came to the conclusion that he will proceed to the venue , address the rally in his usual flair , make it appear as if this was business as usual . It was again decided at the airport itself that the BJP leaders on the podium in Gandhi Maidan would handle it smartly , not allow any kind of panic to prevail and keep telling the audience that these were only firecrackers and would appeal to them not to burst them . . . The BJP leaders ' assessment was that the low intensity blasts at the railway station and at other points in and around Gandhi Maidan were intended to create panic and cause a stampede . . . The success of the Hunkar rally and the way Modi attacked Nitish during his one-hour speech has hugely dented Nitishs electoral prospects . Nitish will devise ways and means to fight that out politically , and first retaliation could be expected on 30 October when he addresses a convention against communalism ( a euphemism for a potential anti-Modi front ) in Delhi . . . But then his capacity to respond effectively has seriously been challenged by the serial blasts . The states inept handling is sharpened by the fact that Nitish has retained the home department portfolio since he came to power eight years ago . . . Firstpost spoke to some leaders , bureaucrats , intelligence and security officials in Bihar . There is a near unanimity in their opinion that the incident has been a huge embarrassment for the chief minister Nitish Kumar , not so much because it happened in Patna during a rally of the BJPs prime ministerial candidate but because of his continued handling of terror-related issues with kid gloves , more specifically when it concerns the homegrown IM module . . . An Intelligence officer posted in Bihar is deeply upset with the attitude of the Bihar government in dealing with security issues . He said Nitishs government has consistently turned a blind eye to the existence of the Darbhanga module of the IM , so much so that it completely detached itself from the investigations in the LOC_Event serial blasts and its escapist act after the arrest of Bhatkal . . . Only few months ago when the nation hailed the IB for getting its biggest catch , the Bihar government withheld state police from interrogating Bhatkal.Never before has a state government looked so deeply embarrassed to claim credit , which was being conferred on it . . . The obvious reasons for going soft against these terrorists and further investigations was that the police would then have to proceed against boys and men from the state , picking them up and charging them with serious terror related offences thereby inviting ire of the Muslim community . The morale of intelligence and security officers is low . Nitish had sharply criticised the NIA and other state police agencies for picking up Muslim boys on alleged terror charges . . . Nitish has called the blasts a blot on Bihar and later assured BJP president Rajnath Singh over phone that he would ensure that the culprits are booked in the next two-three days , but the problems for him are multiple , both administratively and politically . LK Advani had also spoken to him about the incident . Nitish then thought it prudent to call Rajnath Singh at night to convey his concerns and tell him the state government was doing a speedy investigation . Incidentally , this was his first conversation with a senior BJP leader since the time he suo-moto severed his 17-year-old ties with the BJP . . . Nitish is suddenly finding himself to be on a slippery wicket . After Modis forceful speech at Hunkar rally , there have been voices within JD ( U ) questioning Nitishs unilateral decision to dump the BJP . He has committed harakiri , they say . Too early to reach that conclusion , but it 's clear that these should worrisome signs for Nitish . SAMASTIPUR -LRB- LOC_Event -RRB- : Taqui Akhtar , a leader of ruling JD -LRB- U -RRB- and uncle of LOC_Event rally serial blasts mastermind Mohammad Tahseen Akhtar alias Monu , disowned him and sought his severest punishment on Wednesday . ` After division of our ancestral property in January , 2011 at Maniyari village , 8km from the district headquarters and 60 km from LOC_Event , we have no ties with his family , ' Taqui Akhtar , JD -LRB- U -RRB- district general secretary told reporters here . ` We have nothing to do with him and his family after division of our ancestral property , ' he stressed , adding he had already stated it in the complaint he lodged with the Kalyanpur police station after Monu left home . Tahseen Akhtar alias Monu is considered as number two in the Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- after Yasin Bhatkal and investigations have pointed out that he is the mastermind behind the serial blasts in LOC_Event on Sunday before BJP 's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address a rally . Monu 's grandfather Mohammad Jahrul Haque had retired as a police inspector . His father Wasim Akhtar is the eldest of the five brothers and Monu is eldest among the three sons , villagers said . Wasim Akhtar is a marginal farmer and his two younger sons are studying in school . The fugitive IM activist did his matriculation from Maniyari High School and had gone to Darbhanga in connection with preparation for engineering examination where he came in contact with Bhatkal , villagers added . BANGALORE : Tehsin Akhtar alias Monu , the Indian Mujahideen operative who allegedly masterminded Sunday 's LOC_Event serial blasts , is suspected to have been trained in bomb-making by Yasin Bhatkal , the IM co-founder who is currently in custody . IM member Imtiaz Ansari , another suspect arrested for the LOC_Event blasts , has told interrogators that Yasin anointed Tehsin as his successor after his ` satisfactory ' performance , according to police sources . ` Tehsin hails from Bihar 's Maniyarpur village . He met Yasin and Riyaz Bhatkal at a madrasa there in 2005 . In the beginning , Tehsin took care of the IM founder-leaders by arranging their shelter , transport and other daily needs . Impressed by his dedication and commitment , Yasin asked him to join them , ' a source said . Tehsin later became a vital operative who identified places in northern India as potential blast sites . ` Target the South ' Yasin Bhatkal is believed to have told Tehsin that southern states should be targeted with bigger explosions . ` That 's why Tehsin started visiting Mangalore and stayed there for sometime , and also Koppa in Chikmagalur district . It was in Koppa where he and others experimented with a few explosives , ' said the source . He used explosive material commonly available in neighbourhood markets . ` In early 2012 , Tehsin used a local booth near Koppa bus stand to make calls to a mobile phone in Bangalore . That number is now defunct , ' the source said . On the day Delhi police arrested Yasin , Tehsin was in Mangalore . ` Soon after electronic channels aired the news of Yasin 's arrest , Tehsin fled leaving behind explosive material which were recovered by sleuths of the National Investigating Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- later , ' said a police office . During March-April this year , Tehsin frequently shuttled between Mangalore and Bhatkal town . ` We believe Tehsin was all alone in the flat during those months and he visited Bhatkal by a private bus . We have recovered a few private bus tickets from the flat , ' said a source . Ahmedabad : Gujarat Police on Thursday criticised its LOC_Event counterpart , alleging serious lapses in security measures for Chief Minister Narendra Modi 's rally in LOC_Event , saying that had the Bihar administration heeded its request , perhaps the situation could have been avoided . . . Seven blasts rocked Gandhi Maidan , the venue of Modi 's rally and surrounding areas , leading to the death of six people just before the event on Sunday in Patna . . . `` Rehearsals before the event was not carried out , except for the route rehearsal , '' in-charge Gujarat DGP Pramod Kumar 's office said in a statement issued in Ahmedabad . . . `` Anti-sabotage checking , which is mandatory for public meetings was not conducted properly . Routine security drills such as access control , checking and frisking people attending the rally as well as screening of baggage , were not conducted . It is further reported that a large number of vehicles were parked inside the venue of the rally , '' the statement said . . . `` Senior police officers from Gujarat had requested the Bihar police to conduct a joint Advance Security Liaison ( ASL ) . It was only after great persuasion that Bihar police officers agreed to join the ASL , which was conducted by SP ( Patna City ) , Additional Director ( IB ) and SP ( CM Security ) Gujarat . However , Bihar Police officers , for reasons best known to them , had refused to sign the ASL report and had not taken note of relevant issues mentioned therein , '' it said . . . The ADGP ( Intelligence ) Gujarat had sent a detailed communication to ADGP ( Special Branch ) Bihar about the threat faced by Modi from various terrorist organisations , it said . . . `` The Bihar administration did not respond to this communication and never communicated about issues that may be foreseen in providing foolproof security for VIPs and the venue , '' the statement said . . . The Gujarat police hoped that in future , the central government and its apparatus would impress upon states where such visits take place , to take security concerns seriously and protect the lives of people and VIPs , it said . . . The statement comes after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that he had given instructions to his home department and police to provide maximum security for the BJP rally . PATNA : The state BJP on Monday accused the Nitish Kumar government of ` deliberately ' neglecting the security concerns about the party 's PM candidate Narendra Modi and the people who had come to participate in the rally at Gandhi Maidan on Sunday . At least six people died in the serial blasts engineered by suspected IM operatives near the rally venue as well as the railway station . A state BJP delegation would call on governor D Y Patil on Wednesday and submit him a memorandum addressed to President Pranab Mukherjee . The memorandum will give details of the security concerns and apprehensions expressed by the party in the run-up to the rally and the state government 's ` callous stance ' towards the same . BJP chief Mangal Pandey said the memorandum would also point out that the state government 's negligence was ` deliberate ' in the backdrop of the Centre 's general countrywide alert regarding the likely IM threat on October 1 and again on October 23 to various targets , including the rally in Patna on Sunday . ` As far as the Nitish Kumar government is concerned , its neglect of the security matters is criminal , ' former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said , adding the terror operatives ' target was not the crowd , but Narendra Modi . Sushil Modi said a posse of Gujarat police and IB team had held advanced security liaison -LRB- ASL -RRB- meeting with the Bihar police top brass . The Gujarat police and IB put their mandatory signatures on the text of the understanding regarding security arrangements , but the Bihar police did not oblige them . ` Neither full dress rehearsal was performed nor was anti-sabotage check done in LOC_Event , ' he added . Leader of opposition in the state assembly Nand Kishore Yadav said a metal detector was installed only near the stage , not at the entry points of LOC_Event . On the night of October 25 , a contingent of police in the ratio of 1:4 took charge of the stage and continued there till the morning of October 27 , after which Patna DM took control of it . The administration had decided to install 11 CCTV cameras , but on the day of the rally only two could be fixed around 11am . The administration had assured to deploy police personnel for security purposes , but did not . As a result , the services of a private security agency were requisitioned , Yadav said . He said people not carrying passes were allowed to go behind the stage , and the gate of the northwestern campus of Gandhi statue was also opened . After the blast at LOC_Event , police personnel present near the stage started saying a blast had occurred , implicitly asking for winding off the rally . ` Had we not maintained poise , a major stampede would have occurred , ' Yadav said . A member of the bomb disposal squad defuses live bombs found after a search operation by NIA teams in RanchiRanchi : 27 live bombs have been found in a room of a privately-run small hotel in LOC_Event , the capital of Jharkhand and around 350 kilometres from Patna.The bombs were discovered when the National Investigation Agency or NIA along with the Jharkhand Police raided the hotel after a tip-off that Haider Ali , one the main suspects in the serial blasts that hit Patna last month , hours before a Narendra Modi rally , might have been seen there . Four people have been detained for questioning but there have been no arrests.The police said they worked till late last night to defuse the explosives , which were pipe bombs , nine bundles of three each and very similar to those that went off in Patna . A senior cop said they also found `` timer devices with lotus branding , '' much like the ones that were found in Patna and also in the LOC_Event blasts in Bihar some months ago.The bombs found in LOC_Event were powerful ; one of these bundles could have killed about 15 to 10 people and injured another 50 , the police said . Six people were killed and 83 injured in the Patna attack , which investigators link to a newly-formed branch in LOC_Event of terror group Indian Mujahideen , though it has not claimed responsibility.Haider Ali is among the six accused of the attack . Last week , the NIA raided a village in Jharkhand to find him but he managed to escape.Investigators say Haider Ali is allegedly in close touch with Tehseen Akhtar , who has been effectively running the Mujahideen since its reported co-founder Yasin Bhatkal was arrested in August.Those handling the case say that Haider Ali passed on instructions from Tehseen Akhtar to the man assigned to execute the attacks , Imtiaz Ansari . He was arrested while trying to run away from the train station where the first of seven bombs exploded in Patna.Another 11 bombs were found and defused in the city . . The National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- on Thursday filed first charge sheet in the case relating to the last years LOC_Event serial blasts . . . The NIA has so far arrested eight suspects for their alleged involvement in the explosions . . . Investigation into the serial blasts at LOC_Event and LOC_Event railway station was handed over to the NIA . During the probe , eight accused were arrested of whom one succumbed to injuries sustained while planting a bomb at the railway station , said an NIA official . . . Since the investigation in respect of one of the accused , Imtiyaz Ansari , a resident of Dhurwa in Ranchi -LRB- Jharkhand -RRB- , has been completed , the agency filed the charge sheet against him under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code , Explosive Substances Act and other laws at an NIA special court . . . Investigations revealed that Imtiyaz along with others had planted the bombs at the LOC_Event railway station and Gandhi Maidan , where the Hunkar rally of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was being organised . Imtiyaz was associated with the Students Islamic Movement of India and also had very close links with the members of Indian Mujahideen , said an NIA release . . . Cash rewards ranging from Rs . 5 lakh to Rs . 10 lakh have been declared for the arrest of the absconding accused -- Mujibulla , Hyder Ali , Numan and Taufiq Ansari . Efforts are being made to track them down , an official added . Atiq Khan and Praveen Swami . . Bombs go off in LOC_Event , LOC_Event , LOC_Event court complexes ; terrorist reprisal against lawyers . . LUCKNOW AND NEW DELHI : At least 13 persons , including four lawyers , were killed and 60 injured when six bombs went off in three court complexes in LOC_Event on Friday . . . Loaded on cycles parked outside the lawyers chambers in LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event , the bombs were synchronised to explode shortly after 1.15 p.m. . . All the explosions occurred in the courts where suspects linked to recent Islamist terror strikes have been attacked or denied presentation by lawyers , suggesting that they were intended as an act of reprisal . . . Pakistani nationals Mohammad Abid , Mohammad Yusuf and Mirza Rashid , who police say were members of a Jaish-e-Mohammad module assigned to assassinate Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi , were beaten up by LOC_Event lawyers when they were produced in the court on November 18 . . . Five other Jaish terrorists , alleged to have been involved in a 2005 attack on the Babri Masjid complex , were denied representation by LOC_Event lawyers . Their counterparts in LOC_Event refused to defend Mohammad Waliullah , a cleric charged with facilitating the 2006 bombings of the city railway station and the Sankat Mochan temple . . . However , investigators said , the operation might also have been timed to capitalise on the protests against Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen , a trenchant opponent of Islamists in her country . . . Police and National Bomb Data Centre experts said they expected to harvest valuable forensic data and fingerprints from two devices which failed to detonate . One bomb each was recovered from LOC_Event and LOC_Event , while three others were detonated in LOC_Event and two in LOC_Event . One bomb went off in LOC_Event . Based on preliminary research , police sources said the bombs appeared to be made up of ammonium nitrate , widely used in fertilizers and industrial explosives . All eight devices were triggered by a detonator controlled by a quartz alarm clock . Similar bombs were used in the 2006 Varanasi serial bombings , which claimed 20 lives . . . The police sources said a bag , in which the unexploded device was found in the LOC_Event court complex , also contained an envelope addressed to Haji Nasir Ahmad in Riyadh . However , the investigators cautioned against drawing any immediate inference from the finding , noting that the bag and cycles could well have been stolen . . . The investigators said they were using new computer software to analyse calls made between the three cities in recent weeks . Two-and-a-half years ago , Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot announced in a national conference on internal security in New Delhi that the horrifying case of serial blasts in LOC_Event on May 13 , 2008 in which 69 persons were killed stood resolved with the arrest of radical youths in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as well as some Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- members in LOC_Event . He gave credit to the State Anti-Terrorist Squad for cracking the case . . . A fast-track court here on Friday absolved 11 of the 14 so-called SIMI members of all charges and declared them innocent . Additional Sessions Judge Nepal Singh held that the acquitted persons had no links whatsoever with the banned SIMI and were not promoting enmity between different communities , far less being involved in any terrorist activity . . . Some of the exonerated youths gathered here on Saturday to demand that Mr. Gehlot tender an unconditional apology for the pain , trauma and agony that they and their families underwent during the past three years during which they were incarcerated in cramped and dingy cells of the Central Jail here . The jail staff and other hardened criminals tortured them physically and mentally during their imprisonment . . . Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram 's assertion during one of his visits here in 2009 that the Jaipur blasts case was linked with the controversial Batla House encounter of September 2008 reportedly emboldened the jail staff . On Id-ul-Fitr , the day following Mr. Chidambaram 's visit , the security personnel dragged them out of their cells and thrashed them when they sought permission to offer Id prayers along with other prisoners . . . Narrating their traumatic experiences to journalists , Sohail Modi , 33 , and Azam Gajdhar , 31 , hailing from Jodhpur , said the torture and humiliation they suffered first at the hands of ATS officials and later the jail staff was something they could never forget . The regime -LSB- in LOC_Event -RSB- changed during our imprisonment , but there was no change in the attitude of the government officers , said an indignant Mr. Modi . . . After the change of government , our family members met Congress leaders umpteen times seeking a review of our case , but they returned empty-handed every time , said Mr. Modi , whose handicrafts business has been wiped out in the past three years . . . The LOC_Event Muslim Forum , which has pledged its support to the acquitted persons , said Mr. Gehlot had consistently rejected its demand for changing the investigating team appointed during the previous BJP regime and accepted without demur the ATS claim of having cracked the case . Our stand has been vindicated . The court has found no evidence against 11 innocent persons , said Forum convenor Qari Moinuddin . . . The acquitted men demanded legal action against the authorities , including former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje , former Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria and some police officers , for implicating them in the false case . While they would lodge individual complaints in this regard , the Muslim Forum demanded an assistance of Rs .25 lakh for each of them , even though it would not recompense for -LSB- their -RSB- pain and suffering . . . Mr. Gajdhar , who was working with his father on marble , granite and tile fitting before the Special Operations Group picked him up , said a senior police officer who had ordered his arrest and was now in jail in connection with an encounter case had told him that he had acted under the State Government 's pressure to show results and achieve a certain figure of the accused to depict success in solving the case . . . From the kind of people arrested , it is clear that the vocal and socially active youths of the Muslim community were targeted in the crackdown . The -LSB- real -RSB- culprits must be mocking at the incompetence of the ATS , said Mr. Gajdhar 's father Adil Gajdhar . He said the family was facing the stigma of being branded terrorist and anti-national ever since his son 's arrest . . . Kota-based elderly physician Ishaq Qureshi and his son Taufeeq , a unani medicine student , said their family back home faced complete social boycott during their three-year jail term with the denial of bail . Our medical practice is finished . My son 's career is ruined . We do n't know how we will pick up the threads of life , said a dejected Dr. Qureshi . . . After the ATS case against 11 persons crumbling in the court , the focus has shifted to three other accused who have been implicated in the Ahmedabad blasts of July 2008 as well and taken to Sabarmati Jail in Gujarat . Their trial in the LOC_Event case is yet to start . Muslim Forum member M. Salim Engineer said their trial , as well as the hearing of others in the main blasts case should be expedited so that all the accused can prove their innocence . BANGALORE : There 's a certain inevitability about it . It 's now almost a pattern that terrorists strike even before the nation recovers from its last shock , to leave it traumatized again.The target this time was Bangalore , the country 's IT capital , which has been in the terror shadow for long . The city became a target of eight serial blasts on Friday , leaving one dead , eight injured and the city scarred . The bombs were of low intensity , aimed more at dislocating economic activity than killing hundreds of people . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Only in May , 68 people were killed by terrorists in Jaipur . Even as the police was groping to identify the culprits there , terrorists cocked a snook at the security agencies , triggering eight serial blasts in 35 minutes at seven places during the busy lunch hour . -LRB- In Pics : Bangalore serial bomb blasts -RRB- The lone victim was Sudha , who was waiting at the Madivala bus stand . Her husband Ravi , who was standing beside her , was severely injured . Two others Chetan and Gullamma were also injured.Police said the bombs were put together with ammonium nitrate , commonly used in gelatin sticks , and used nuts and bolts as shrapnel . Timer devices were used to trigger the blasts between 1.40 pm and 2.15 pm in non-descript places on a traffic island , inside a drain , a vacant plot next to a vehicle showroom . As word of the blasts spread , malls , cinema halls and schools shut down for the day.No group claimed responsibility until late Friday , but intelligence sources said Lashkar-e-Taiba and SIMI were main suspects . ` The aim of these groups , whether Huji , LeT or SIMI , is clear . Bangalore and Hyderabad are chosen because by hitting them , panic can be conveyed to US and the west as these cities house their biggest IT operations , ' said a security official involved in the Mecca Masjid probe . New Delhi : The serial blasts in LOC_Event came a day after the blasts in LOC_Event . . . However , the similarities , many would say do not end there . In fact , the blasts in both the cities were of low-intensity and took place in crowded places . `` The blasts were of low intensity and similar to those which hit LOC_Event , '' Union Minister of State for Home Sriprakash Jaiswal told reporters in Kanpur . . . And while the party top brass refused to comment on this similarity , both states - Karnataka and Gujarat - are ruled by the BJP . Advani refrained from commenting on whether BJP-ruled states were being targeted but demanded the Centre must have stringent anti-terror laws in place . . . BJP president Rajnath Singh blamed the UPA government for its `` soft approach '' because of which terrorists had grown bolder . . . He also took the government to task for repealing POTA and for `` sleeping over the anti-terror laws like GUJCOCA ( an anti-terror law adopted by the Gujarat Assembly ) '' . . . Reacting to his statement , Congress party 's chief spokesperson Veerappa Moily said , `` It is an irresponsible statement , not befitting the occasion . It does not befit a national leader to speak in that kind of tone . '' . . Police said at least 20 persons were killed and the deaths were reported from Vadilal Sarabhai , Civil and LG hospitals . . . Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil has convened a high level meeting on Sunday morning to review the security situation across the country . . . . FARIDABAD : Two persons have been detained for questioning by Faridabad Police in connection with a call allegedly made to Delhi Police on Friday , saying that the capital will witness another blast . -LRB- Watch -RRB- The two men were detained on Saturday night after LOC_Event was hit by a bomb blast in LOC_Event area in which three people have succumbed to their injuries and 23 others have been wounded , a Faridabad Police officer said on Sunday . He said the call was traced to a cell phone belonging to man from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh , who had allegedly made the call to Delhi Police on Friday evening . The man , who had made the call from the vicinity of a mobile phone tower in Mohan Nagar area , had stated ` Delhi bachaloh , blast hoga ' -LRB- Save Delhi , there will be blast -RRB- , he said . The man had allegedly purchased the SIM card from a shopowner in Bhikam Colony in Ballabgarh area , the police officer said , adding that the two have been detained for questioning and that they have not yet been arrested.On Saturday , a crude bomb exploded at a crowded flower market at LOC_Event , LOC_Event , close to the historic Qutub Minar , at 2.05 pm . -LRB- Watch -RRB- A nine-year-old boy , who innocently picked up a black polythene bag containing a tiffin box bomb , was killed on the spot as it exploded in his face.One of the injured -- a 60-year-old unidentified man whose cervical was badly fractured -- succumbed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences late in the evening , AIIMS sources said.Police have ruled out the involvement of the Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- . Six people were detained in connection with the blast as security was stepped up in the capital . Delhi Police was not willing to confirm that it had received warning of a strike from an anonymous caller in Faridabad or that it had received an email to that effect on September 24 . According to eyewitnesses , the electronic goods market was packed with shoppers when a black Pulsar motorbike went through the narrow lane intent on its deadly business . It had two helmeted riders , who dropped the polythene bag with its deadly payload in the middle of the road , in front of a shop , Anisha Electronics . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Out on an errand , the nine-year-old boy , Santosh , thought the men had unknowingly dropped the bag . In a heartbreaking act of kindness to strangers , Santosh rushed to pick it up , running after them as he shouted for them to stop . It was then that white smoke began to pour out of the bag . The little boy dropped it , but too late to save his own life.This happened around 2.05 pm . The victims were rushed to AIIMS and Fortis hospitals , where 10 of them are reported to be critical while others are out of danger , said hospital sources.Police said that the blast appeared to be similar in nature to the ones that took place near IIT and Lado Sarai in January , February this year . A team of National Security Guard -LRB- NSG -RRB- reached the spot with sniffer dogs and was examining the blast site . A team of forensic experts have also reached the spot . The national capital has been put on high alert . The explosion comes exactly two weeks after the serial blasts in Delhi , in which about two dozen people were killed . Ammonium Nitrate in little quantity along with Sulphar and Potassium was used in Saturday 's blast in South Delhi 's Mehrauli area that killed two people and left nearly two dozen people injured . Officials said loosely packed Ammonium Nitrate with one-and-a-half inch nails , which acted as shrapnels leading to injuries , was used in the blast with quantity of Sulphur used to create the dark smoke . Potassium was used as the triggering mechanism as this material burns due to friction and contact with air . The packing of explosive was very loose thus making it a low-intensity explosion . Ammonium Nitrate was used in the five serial blasts that shook the national capital on September 13 , leaving 24 people dead and many others injured . In order to restrict sale of Ammonium Nitrate , used extensively by terror groups to strike in various parts of the country , the government had ` in-principle ' approved for amendment of the Explosives Substances Act to include it . . . The in-principle approval was given at a special cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week . The chemical was believed to have been used in recent series of explosions in Bangalore , Ahmedabad and Delhi and in many earlier blasts including the serial train blasts in LOC_Event , LOC_Event and LOC_Event blasts . Security agencies have long been pressing for bringing a strong controlling regime to check misuse of the chemical especially in Naxal-affected states . The bomb was planted by two motorcycle-borne youth in their early 30 's , Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police -LRB- Southern Range -RRB- Ajay Kashyap said . ` The two youth were in black dress , were wearing black helmets and riding a black Bajaj Pulsar . So it has not been possible for the eye witnesses to identify them , ' he told reporters hours after the blast . Kashyap said the Delhi Police was in touch with the Gurgaon Police as the blast site was located near the city . ` We have also issued a look out notice , ' he said . Oct. 24 : A young sadhvi known for bashing up rogue Romeos and flaunting her prowess with the rifle was slapped with murder charges along with two men for last months blast in Maharashtras LOC_Event . . . The arrests were made by the Mumbai anti-terrorist squad ( ATS ) over the past one week from Surat , where the sadhvi , Pragya Singh Thakur , is now based , and from Madhya Pradesh . . . Joint commissioner of Mumbai police and ATS chief Hemant Karkare said : We have arrested Pragya Singh Chandrapal Singh Thakur alias Purna Chetananand Giri , 38 , Shivnarain Gopal Singh Kalsaangra , 36 , and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu , 42 , for plotting the LOC_Event explosions . They have been produced in a Nashik court and we ( the police ) have their custody till November 3 . . . Public prosecutor Ajay Mishra said the trio had been slapped with charges of murder , attempt to murder , criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity between different groups on religious grounds . They were also booked under the explosives act . . . The ATS claimed its probe had revealed that RDX was used in the September explosion just ahead of Id . The blast killed five persons . . . The remand application mentioned that among other evidence , the police had recorded telephone conversations of up to 400 minutes between Pragya and her co-accused after the blast . . . Karkare said Pragya had taken sanyas in 2007 and set up two organisations , the Jai Vande Mataram Janakalyan Samiti and the Rashtriya Janjagran Manch , in Indore . . . As evidence of her involvement , the ATS said the LML Freedom motorcycle on which the bomb had been placed was found registered in her name . . . The rear portion of the bike was mangled , and the probe showed that the chassis number and the original registration number had been tampered with . . . The police were not forthcoming on the evidence against the other two . Sources said Shyam Sahu ran a SIM card shop in Indore . . . Pragyas father C.P. Singh Thakur , 68 , an ayurvedic doctor in Surat , scoffed at the flimsy evidence and claimed that his daughter had sold the motorcycle but had forgotten to whom and that she did not have any papers to show for that . . . She has been arrested because she could not name the person she sold her motorcycle to , said Thakur . . . Thakur recalled that Pragya , during her college days in Madhya Pradesh , was a prominent , and feared , student leader . She would ride a motorcycle and severely beat up rogue Romeos harassing girls , earning admiration in a male-dominated society . . . Pragya is believed to be a former member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) , the student wing of the BJP , and the Durga Vahini , the womens wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad . In 2001 , she is said to have got herself photographed practising rifle shooting at a camp organised by the Durga Vahini . . . The BJP is fighting shy of defending the accused as the party leadership does not want to be clubbed with those who are defending the accused in the Jamianagar encounter . . . BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said : Our only objection is they are being described as Hindu terrorists . CPM leader Brinda Karat called them Hindu terrorists . We have categorically said we dont link religion with terrorism . . . The Congress is still wary of going ballistic with the issue as it is trying to ascertain Pragyas credentials as an insider of the ABVP . She is also believed to be a disciple of Swami Avadeshanand Maharaj , who is close to a Union minister and his politician son . WASHINGTON A former Defense Department official said Wednesday that American intelligence agencies had determined that former officers from Pakistans Army and its powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency helped train the Mumbai attackers . . Pune : Mirza Himayat Baig , the lone convicted accused in the 2010 German Bakery bombing that killed 17 and wounded 64 , was on Thursday sentenced to death for murder and criminal conspiracy by a sessions court here which termed his crime as ` rarest of rare ' . . . Additional sessions judge N P Dhote , after hearing the day-long arguments on the quantum of sentence , pronounced his verdict , saying the case fell under the ` rarest of the rare ' category warranting the most severe punishment . . . The court had on April 15 pronounced Baig , the only person arrested in the blast at the popular eatery on February 13 , 2010 , that brought Pune on the terror radar , guilty of involvement in the crime . Six others named in the charge sheet in the case , including Yasin Bhatkal who is alleged to have planted the bomb , are still absconding . . . The judge sentenced Baig to death under sections 302 ( murder ) , 120 ( b ) ( criminal conspiracy ) , of IPC , besides section 16 ( a ) of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( UAPA ) and section 3 of Explosive Substances Act which attract death penalty . He was also awarded concurrent life imprisonment under various other sections of IPC , UAPA and Explosives Substances Act . . . Baig , who had looked composed when pronounced guilty three days back , was shaken and momentarily fainted today after the judge read out the sentence . . . He was given water to drink while being escorted out of the court by policemen under tight security even as some social groups burst firecrackers outside the premises hailing the judicial system . . . When asked by the judge as to what he had to say about the verdict , Baig broke down and pleaded innocence , alleging that he had been falsely implicated in the case by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad led by Rakesh Maria . . . ' I am innocent and have nothing to do with the German Bakery bombing . Police have failed to nab the real culprit and I have been made the scapegoat in the case . While 17 persons died in the explosion , I have been made the 18th victim , ' he told the judge . . . Earlier , public prosecutor Raja Thakre , pressing for death penalty argued that the court had held the accused guilty under 14 out of 17 charges levelled against him including those of murder , criminal conspiracy and possession of the deadly RDX . . . ` The accused committed an act of terror in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy . The image of India will be lowered in the eyes of the international community if there is no guarantee of safety in the country as among the deceased in the bomb blast were five foreigners . . . ` Baig was in possession of the special category explosive substance such as RDX and was also in the company of the person who planted bomb in the bakery , ' Thakre said , contending there were no mitigating circumstances to show leniency to Baig . . . Referring to defence counsel ` s argument that young age ( 33 ) of the accused too was a ground for a lighter sentence , Thakre said terrorists Kasab and Yakub Memon were also given death sentence notwithstanding their age . . . ` It is a fit case for extreme penalty of death for social justice and does not deserve any leniency , ' he said . . . Defence counsel A Rahaman said the case did not fall under the rarest of the rare category and the alleged links of the accused with Indian Mujahiddin ( IM ) and Lashker-e-Toiba ( LeT ) had not been proved . . . ` The actual culprit Yasin Bhatkal , who planted the bomb is absconding . Baig never visited the German Bakery to plant the bomb . Death penalty is an exception and life sentence should be the rule , ' he told the court , pleading for a lenient view to taken . . . Rahman later said he would go in appeal to High court against the sentence . . . A heavy security blanket was thrown in and around the court when Baig was brought under heavy escort by Maharashtra ATS and state police personnel . . . The judge upheld all prosecution charges against Baig except for those relating to forgery under sections 465 , 467 and 468 of IPC . . . The 33-year-old Baig , who hails from Beed district of Maharashtra , was convicted of hatching a criminal conspiracy in March 2008 in Colombo with six other accused -- Yasin Bhatkal , Mohsin Chaudhary , Riyaz Bhatkal , Iqbal Bhatkal , Fayyaz Kagzi and Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal . . . Barring Jundal , one of the handlers of 26/11 terrorists , all others are absconding . Jundal , facing trial in several terror cases , has not been arrested in the German Bakery blast . . . The bombing of the popular eatery located in plush Koregaon Park area of the city in the vicinity of the Osho Ashram and Jewish community centre , had exposed vulnerability of the city as a terrorist target . . . LeT operative David Headley had recced the bakery during his various visits to India to scout for potential terror targets . LOC_Event Indian authorities issued security alerts in several major cities on Tuesday evening after a bomb detonated in the LOC_Event of Varanasi . The police said the explosion and ensuing panic of pilgrims left a toddler dead and at least 20 other people injured . . LOC_Event : Three days after triple blasts ripped through LOC_Event during the evening rush hour , security agencies are still groping for clues with nothing significant emerging from the investigations so far.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- today ruled out the involvement of a suicide bomber in the serial explosions that killed 19 people and injured 131 . -LRB- In Pics : Terror revisits LOC_Event -RRB- It further added that a probable suspect 's sketch was being prepared based on eyewitness accounts . `` Investigations done so far and visit to the sites by forensic experts and investigators suggest that there was no suicide bomber , '' said ATS chief Rakesh Maria in a joint press conference alongwith the Mumbai Police . -LRB- Watch : Blast suspect 's sketch soon , say cops -RRB- The announcement puts to rest speculation over the involvement of a suicide bomber after a corpse , found from one of the blast sites , had an embedded electrical circuit . The body was found by doctors at JJ Hospital where victims of the blasts were being rushed in.At the core of the ongoing investigations now is the CCTV footage from the blast sites - 11 CDs to be precise - that the security agencies are heavily relying upon to zero in on the people who could have planted the bombs . -LRB- Read : Cops scouring 46 CCTV cameras for clues -RRB- Admitting that the footage was `` voluminous '' and `` grainy '' , Mr Maria said that investigators were seeking technical help to get better images.The videos recovered from the CCTV cameras are currently being matched with those installed at various entry and exit points at the city.But despite the investigations , there is no clear word yet on who was responsible for the blasts . The police refused to speculate on the involvement of any terror group , adding that members of various modules arrested in the past were being questioned . Sources , though , have told NDTV that the Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- , a proxy for the Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- , is slowly emerging as the top suspect . -LRB- Read : Focus on key Indian Mujahideen operatives , say sources -RRB- According to sources , splinter groups of the IM , which suffered a huge blow after the arrest of 21 of its key operatives in 2008 , may have regrouped and could have executed the attacks on Wednesday.The Maharshtra ATS is collecting information from the Gujarat Police on the recent arrest of IM operative Danish Khan who is suspected to have regrouped this new module . Teams of the Gujarat Crime Branch and Uttar Pradesh 's Special Task Force -LRB- STF -RRB- are in LOC_Event in connection with the probe.The UP STF is gathering leads on members of the IM 's Azamgarh module who escaped recently . The Maharashtra ATS has also sought assistance from the Kolkata Police asking them to verify if any IM suspects had travelled to LOC_Event from Kolkata and subsequently went underground after the blasts.Also under the scanner are IM 's Karnataka-based operatives Riaz and Iqbal Bhatkal , who fled to Pakistan after masterminding a series of blasts between 2005 and 2007 in LOC_Event and LOC_Event . . LOC_Event : Investigators were groping for leads on Wednesday 's blast at Delhi High Court even as an email was sent to a TV channel claiming that the attack was carried out by Indian Mujahidin and not HuJI and threatening attacks on shopping complexes on Tuesday . The email sent by one Chhotu , an alleged IM operative , was traced to Ahmedabad . Although Delhi Police detained five persons including one who had booked himself on a flight leaving for Saudi Arabia on Thursday , sources in NIA and Delhi Police acknowledged that they had no clue yet to the perpetrator of the attack that shattered the respite that the Capital has had from big terror strikes . The Saudi Arabia-bound suspect was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for verification by the injured undergoing treatment . Investigating agencies were working on the assumption that the attack was the handiwork of a local module . All the five who have been detained are from the NCR region . On Thursday , investigators traced the ` HuJI ' mail received on Wednesday ` owning up ' to the blast to Global Internet Cafe in Kishtwar in Jammu . The cafe owner and two others have been detained for questioning but the youth who has been identified as the likely email author , a frequent visitor to the establishment , is yet to be traced . The HuJI email threatened more strikes unless the death sentence of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was commuted . Although a manhunt was on for him , sources were not sure whether he was actually linked to the perpetrators of the attack , or was just one of the sympathizers of Guru seeking to cash in on the attack . The email ID used for sending the email was created at 1.04 pm -- more than two hours after the briefcase bomb went off -- something that raises the suspicion that the email may have been a clumsy effort to highlight Guru 's plea . The new email , allegedly sent by the IM at 12.37 pm from the id , said the terror group 's next target would be a shopping area . ` Hamara agla target jald hi rang layega jo ek shopping complex ke bahar hoga . Use koi nahi rok sakta aur yeh agle tuesday ko hoga . rok sako toh rok lo . -LRB- Our next target is a shopping complex . If you can stop it , stop it -RRB- , ' the sender identifying himself as Chotoo said . Like the HuJI email , the language was hurried and did not match the elaborate IM emails that followed serial blasts in 2008 . The messages were sent without much preparation . Also , unlike the previous IM emails which were timed to coincide with blasts carried out by the group , the one sent by Chhotu arrived a day later and that too in response to the alleged email by HuJI . Home ministry officials are , however , not dismissing the email , with U K Bansal , secretary , internal security , saying , ` We are examining the email received by media houses for its authenticity and veracity and we are taking it seriously . ' The ` rok sako to rok lo ' tagline matches previous IM emails . Investigators also emphasized that Asghar Ali Peerbhoy , a techie from Pune who was responsible for drafting and dispatching the earlier emails , was behind bars and that this could be the reason for the crude draft of the one sent by Chhotu on Thursday . Incidentally , Chhotu is also the alias of a jailed IM terrorist Salman . The IM email is crudely written in Hindi using Roman script and spells Mujahideen as Muzahiddin . Although investigators are looking at all possibilities , including the threat posed by Khalistani groups , the IM remains the key suspect . The IM network was busted in 2008 but some key elements like the Shanbandri brothers Riyaz and Iqbal are believed to be located in Pakistan from where they help plan and execute attacks in LOC_Event . Absconding IM members like Shahnawaz and Junaid who escaped the Batla House encounter on September 19 , 2008 are high on the list of suspects . Police and NIA personnel are questioning jailed IM members like Salman and Shehzad who were arrested a few months after the Batla House encounter . Police officers are drawing attention to an Intelligence Bureau report last year about Shahnawaz and Junaid having escaped to Pakistan for advanced bomb making training . ` Wednesday 's bomb , which was made with some sophistication , could have been made by IM members with the help of Pakistan-based outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba , ' said an officer . Delhi Police believes the previous May 25 Delhi High Court blast was also carried out by the IM but the bomb did not explode properly as detonators failed . The suspicion of Khalistani angle has to do with a July 29 intelligence alert that secessionist Sikhs could retaliate against the confirmation of death sentence of Khalistan Commando Force 's Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar . The Khalistani inputs came in mid-July from Canada based sources . Khalistanis resurfaced as a threat a couple of years ago after inputs were received from UK . Investigations led to arrests in Rajasthan . The mail from chotoomanini5@gmail.com rubbished HuJI 's alleged claims and said ` the blast was carried out by them -LRB- Indian Mujahideen -RRB- ' . Wednesday had been chosen of the preferred day as it a busy day at the high court . New Delhi : The fourth suspected Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) operative allegedly involved in the 1 August Pune blast was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police , an official said Wednesday . The other three accused were arrested earlier . . . The accused has been identified as Landge Irfan Mustafa , 30 . He was arrested near a bus stand in Jaipur on 10 October , police said . . . `` Mustafa was one of the other accused in the Pune blast . Many are still absconding , '' said Special Commissioner of Police ( Special Cell ) SN Srivastav . . . Mustafa is undergoing 20 days of police custody , which ends on 30 October . . . Asad Khan , 33 , and Imran Khan , 31 were arrested from south Delhi on 26 September . The third alleged operative , Sayed Firoz alias Hamza , 38 , was arrested on 1 October from the Nizamuddin Railway Station here . HYDERABAD/MUMBAI : Two days after twin blasts rocked the city , the Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday claimed to have got ` vital clues ' to crack the case soon with the needle of suspicion zeroing in on banned terror outfit Indian Mujahideen . ` We have already gathered vital clues in the case . We are confident we will crack the case soon , ' state home minister P Sabita Indra Reddy said after a high-level review meeting chaired by chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy . Thursday 's serial blasts left 16 dead and over 117 injured . The modus operandi adopted by the perpetrators like ammonium nitrate and splinters-laden aluminium containers fitted to bicycles used in the blasts pointed the needle of suspicion towards Indian Mujahideen . Reddy said 15 special teams of Andhra Pradesh police , each having 10-15 personnel , have been constituted to probe the case and bring the culprits to justice . Director General of National Investigation Agency S C Sinha discussed with state police officials the ongoing investigation . Amid reports that some CCTV cameras at the blast sites were not functioning , the state home minister said 3500 closed-circuit cameras would be installed at vital locations under Hyderabad and Cyberabad police commissionerates to improve vigil . Meanwhile , Abdul Wasey Mirza , a 23-year-old unemployed youth who fell victim to terror attack for a second time on Thursday in the Dilsukhnagar blasts , has been questioned by police which clarified he is not being treated as a suspect . ` As part of the investigations we only recorded his statement as a witness along with others , ' Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anurag Sharma said . ` Nothing like that , ' Sharma said when asked whether the police suspected Mirza 's involvement in the attack after a media report suggested the fact that he survived both 2007 Mecca Masjid and Dilsukhnagar blasts had aroused suspicion about his possible role in the explosions . Looking for clues to track down the perpetrators , Cyberabad and Hyderabad police have questioned some local youths but made it clear that nobody has been detained so far . ` Media reports that we have detained some persons are totally baseless . We only called some people for questioning , which is a normal investigating procedure , ' a top police official said . Investigators said they were following some leads from CCTV footages , including of a man seen coming to the blast site on a bicycle with a bag . Mobile call records from the area at the time of the explosions were also being examined . Sleuths of the National Investigation Agency have obtained details about persons lodged in the Chanchalguda jail here with suspected terror links and some of them were also questioned , informed sources said .
