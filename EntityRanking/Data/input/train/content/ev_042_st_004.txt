One person was killed and seven were injured , three of them seriously , in a powerful explosion that rocked the Upper Assam town of Sivasagar on Monday night . The explosion occurred at around 9 pm . Sivasagar SP A K Singh blamed the anti-talk faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom ( ULFA ) for it . . . It is the handiwork of the ULFA which has been trying to cause mischief in the district in the past few weeks . They had recently triggered off an explosion in Sonari town too , the SP said . The explosion that occurred in the busy Central Market in the heart of Sivasagar town was caused by a device that was apparently kept on a bicycle . . . Reports from Sivasagar said the dead has been identified as one Lulu Das , a shopkeeper who was just coming out after shutting down his shop . While Das died on the way to the hospital , two of the injured have been shifted to the Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh . . . .
