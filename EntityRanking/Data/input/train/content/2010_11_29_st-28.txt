The Hyderabad bomb blast accused , Swami Asimanand , currently in CBI custody in Andhra Pradesh on remand , is likely to be brought to Dangs district in south Gujarat in the next couple of days for investigation into his past activities in the region . The Swami , who was in-charge of the Shabari Dham in Subir village in Dangs district , spent nearly two decades in this tribal-dominated area . An activist of the Hindu Jagaran Manch , a voluntary organisation working for the revival of Hinduism , the Swami also launched a campaign in the district to re-convert the tribals to the Hindu fold . Shabari Kumbh Under the convenership of the Swami , the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had organised a massive Shabari Kumbh in the Subir village in 2006 . More than one lakh tribals from Dangs and other neighbouring districts in Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra had participated in the three-day extravaganza , also attended by top leaders of the BJP . A team of CBI officials is expected to accompany the Swami to Dangs to investigate his past activities in the region and look for his sympathisers who might have helped him with manpower and funds for carrying out the bomb blasts , the CBI sources said . Gujarat police sources , however , claimed that there was still no information about the CBI team 's visit to Dangs with the blast accused .
