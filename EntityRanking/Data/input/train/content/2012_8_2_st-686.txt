Security at vital installations and residences of senior government functionaries in the Capital was stepped up in the wake of a series of low-intensity blasts in Pune on Wednesday . The security personnel deployed at the 7 Race Course Road residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were alerted and the entire area surrounding the bungalow barricaded soon after the blasts , which obstructed smooth vehicular flow . A high alert was sounded in the city and all the police stations besides special units instructed to keep a watch on any suspicious activity . Extra security personnel were also deployed in and around Metro stations , particularly those located near vital installations like Parliament and railway stations . Bomb detection and disposal squads are on stand-by . All emergency services have been activated to meet any contingency , said an officer .
