NEW DELHI : The NIA has zeroed in on the shop in Guwahati that sold exactly 13 Lotus ' brand clocks to a man ahead of Bodh Gaya blasts - same as the number of bombs planted in temple complex . Each of these clocks was used as a timer in the bombs . The investigators have also traced the cylinders to Meerut , and believe that the poor quality ' cylinders were manufactured by an unregistered facility there . However , they were possibly bought in Bihar itself , where they are transported by the Meerut plant for sales . The NIA investigators have confirmed from the Rajkot-based manufacturer of Lotus ' brand clocks that it had recently sent a sales consignment of 300 clocks to Assam . Interestingly , a shopkeeper in Guwahati also revealed that a man had bought 13 of these clocks in a single transaction . The investigators are now trying to establish the identity of this buyer . Two monks were injured in ten blasts that took place early in the morning of July 7 in Bodh Gaya . Three unexploded bombs were found . The temple and the Bodhi Tree , under which Lord Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment , did not suffer any damage in the blasts which shook the holy town frequented by Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka , Myanmar , China , Japan and the whole of south east Asia .
