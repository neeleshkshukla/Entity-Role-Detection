A blast occurred on the premises of the Arakandanallur police station near here on Friday night , damaging window panes in the building . It created panic among police personnel and residents of the locality . Deputy Inspector-General of Police ( Villupuram Range ) K. Shanmugavel , Superintendent of Police N. Bhaskaran along with a contingent of police personnel rushed to the spot . Mr. Shanmugavel told The Hindu that it was a low-intensity explosion from a dump of fireworks seized from unlicensed vendors . The fireworks were kept in the space between the new and old buildings of the police station . Owing to high daytime temperature , the fireworks might have caught fire and exploded . Nobody was injured in the blast , Mr. Shanmugavel said . Mr. Bhaskaran told this correspondent that Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad personnel , who had come from Chennai , examined the residue . They concluded that it was the kind of fireworks being used in rural areas during local festivals . Had it been a crude bomb or any sort of improvised explosive device , a crater would have formed . In this case , the blast did not affect the floor . Therefore , the role of anti-social elements or any sabotage attempt was ruled out .
