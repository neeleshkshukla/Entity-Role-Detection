Two minors were lying in a pool of blood with their faces completely disfigured while several others lay writhing in pain screaming for help , ' said an eyewitness , indicating the magnitude of the human tragedy caused by the powerful explosion at Chheh Tuti Chowk in the Paharganj area of Central Delhi on Black Saturday . . . It all happened around 5-30 p.m. when the area was packed with Diwali shoppers . Like many other local residents , Ajit Singh was sitting in his house when he heard the blast . His three-storey building shook under the impact of the explosion . ' I rushed out and saw people running towards the fruit market . I followed suit , ' said Singh , shocked by what he had seen . ` Two small children were lying unconscious . A portion of the head of one of them lay ripped apart . A woman , probably their mother , also lay nearby . I along with local shopkeepers and three policemen lifted the injured and packed them off in private vehicles to nearby hospitals , ' he said , adding that six people were killed on the spot , one of whom was a ` golgappa-wala ' . . . The intensity of the blast could be gauged from the fact that M.L.

Adjacent to the shop , a medical store was also badly damaged . Hoardings of many shops in the area were torn apart and windowpanes of shops and residential buildings were shattered within a 50-metre diameter .
