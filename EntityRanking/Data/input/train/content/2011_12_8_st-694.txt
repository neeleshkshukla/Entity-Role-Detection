A year after an explosion had rocked the Dashashwamedh ghat in Varanasi , security agencies are clueless about the module that was used to trigger the bomb blast that left a 2-year-old girl dead and over three dozen injured . Those behind the blast continued to remain a mystery for investigators as did the nature of the explosive material used to trigger the bomb . However , Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) had claimed responsibility for the blast in e-mails sent to media houses and said the incident was in response to demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 . The recent modules busted by the Delhi Police in which six persons allegedly belonging to the IM were arrested have expressed their ignorance about the Varanasi explosion . Security forces have rounded up many people and jailed terrorists were questioned without any results . There was a move to handover the probe to the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) but it was dropped because of issues between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh Government .
