A wave of car bombings tore through mostly Shia Muslim neighbourhoods of the Baghdad area on Monday afternoon , leaving at least 57 dead . Iraq has been hit by a wave of bloodshed that has killed more than 300 people in the past two weeks alone . There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attacks bore the hallmarks of Al-Qaeda 's Iraqi arm , the Islamic State of Iraq , which frequently uses car bombs and coordinated blasts in an effort to undermine Iraqis confidence in the Shia-led government . The recent wave of bloodshed has raised tensions between the countrys Sunni minority and Shia-led government . The surge in violence has been reminiscent of the sectarian carnage in 2006 and 2007 . Alarmed by a nationwide deterioration in the security situation , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has ordered a reshuffle in senior military ranks .
