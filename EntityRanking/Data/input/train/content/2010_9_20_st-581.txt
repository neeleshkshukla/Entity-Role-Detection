Two near-simultaneous car bombs rocked the Iraqi capital on Sunday , killing at least 29 people and wounding 111 in the city 's deadliest day in a month . The violence was the worst to hit Iraq since U.S. troops declared an official end to combat operations on September 1 , and comes with no new government yet formed since a March general election . The twin blasts struck near the Aden junction in north Baghdad and in the residential district of Mansur in the west of the capital at around 10:10 a.m. ( 0710 GMT ) , said AFP journalists and security officials . An Interior Ministry official put the death toll at 29 19 in Aden and 10 in Mansur . It was a minibus the driver stopped and told people nearby that he was going to go see a doctor , said a witness to the Aden bombing . A few minutes later , it exploded . An AFP journalist at the scene said the blast , against a National Security department office building , left a crater three metres in diameter and that security forces had cordoned off the area . In Mansur , another AFP journalist reported seeing several bloodied bodies on the street , with many cars burned out and two buildings destroyed , while nearby houses were also badly damaged . Also on Sunday , a father and son were killed when a magnetic bomb was attached to their car in Ghazaliyah , west Baghdad .
