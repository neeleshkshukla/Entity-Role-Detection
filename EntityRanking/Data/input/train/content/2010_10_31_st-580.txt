The death toll from a suicide bombing at a coffee house in central Iraq 's restive Diyala province has risen to 30 , a medical official said on Saturday , making the deadliest attack in October . Friday night 's bombing in the town of Balad Ruz also wounded 68 people , according to Ahmed Alwan , a doctor at the general hospital of Baquba , the provincial capital of Diyala . The final toll from Friday 's bombing is 30 dead and 68 wounded . All the dead are men , but the wounded include three women and two children , Dr. Alwan said . Balad Ruz police chief Major Ahmed al-Tamimi had given on Friday a toll of 25 dead and 70 wounded when a suicide bomber detonated a belt filled with explosives at a coffee house in the centre of the city . Fall in bombings Suicide bombings across Iraq have fallen since 2008 when Diyala province was an Al-Qaeda stronghold . Although the militants have lost ground , the province remains one of the most restive since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . Friday 's attack took place in a region with a Kurdish Shia majority . Baquba , once a stronghold of Al-Qaeda , is the ethnically mixed capital of Diyala , which remains one of the country 's most unstable provinces . The blast was the first major attack in Iraq in several weeks , as a seven-month political stalemate surrounding the formation of a new government has dragged on .
