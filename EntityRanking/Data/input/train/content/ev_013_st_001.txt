Police suspect the banned United Liberation Front of Asom ( ULFA ) , to be behind it . As soon as the bus reached Majgaon area under Mathurapur police station , a powerful blast ripped apart the bus killing four passengers , including a woman on the spot , and injuring 18 others . While one passenger died at Sonari Civil Hospital , two others died on way to the Assam Medical College Hospital ( AMCH ) in neighbouring Dibrugarh district . Seven of the critically injured passengers were admitted to the AMCH . Police were still trying to ascertain if the blast occurred inside the bus or an explosive device had been planted on the road . A gas cylinder carried by one of the passengers could have added to the intensity to the blast .
