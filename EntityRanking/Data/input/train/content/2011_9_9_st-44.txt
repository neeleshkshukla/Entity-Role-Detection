Blast victims are also undergoing treatment at the Safdarjung Hospital and some private hospitals . Relatives angry At RML Hospital , angry relatives of the victims who shouted slogans against Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday night maintained that they did not want political leaders visiting the hospital . Political leaders visiting the injured does not mean much , they just create confusion here and delay treatment being provided to the injured . They should , however , be working towards ensuring that the common man does not suffer and is able to live peacefully . We do n't want them in hospitals offering sympathy . We want the government to ensure that proper treatment is provided and that the relatives do n't have a problem at various hospitals , said a relative of a blast victim admitted at the RML Hospital . Emergency unit Meanwhile , the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry has made functional an emergency medical relief unit ( in addition to control rooms functioning at RML and other hospitals ) at Nirman Bhavan to help people seeking information on patients admitted to various hospitals in the wake of bomb blast . The control room can be contacted at numbers 23061302 and 23061469 .
