NEW DELHI , Sept. 27 -- A small bomb exploded in a crowded hardware and electronics market in the southern part of the Indian capital Saturday , killing one person and wounding at least 18 . . . The explosion occurred about 2:15 p.m. in a neighborhood where both Hindus and Muslims live and near a historic 12th-century stone minaret . . . No group has asserted responsibility for the attack , which came two weeks after a series of bombings ripped through the capital , killing 21 people . . . Police said two men on a black motorcycle dropped a plastic bag containing a lunchbox and sped away . Inside the lunchbox was a crude , low-intensity bomb , authorities said . . . `` The bag was picked up by a young boy , and it exploded . And the boy lost his life , '' said Y.S. Dadwal , the city 's police commissioner . . . Sanjay Dhingra , who runs a kitchenware store in the area , said the boy was standing in the street watching television . . . `` When he saw the men on the bike , he called out , ` Uncle , you have left your bag behind , ' and picked up the bag , '' said Dhingra , whose clothes were stained with blood from helping the injured . `` Then the explosion took place . We heard a loud bomb , and everything went black for a moment . The boy died right there . '' . . A spokesman at the trauma care center at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said that seven of the injured were in critical condition . . . There have been several attacks across India recently , and a little-known group called the Indian Mujahideen has asserted responsibility for them . . . .
