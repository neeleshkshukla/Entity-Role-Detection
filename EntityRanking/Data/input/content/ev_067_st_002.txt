The Jaish is based in the Pakistan-controlled territory , while HuJI operates out of Bangladesh . . . According to informed sources , the Central agencies had inputs , dating back to March/April , that the Jaish operatives were under pressure from their handlers across the Line of Control to ` do something . ' Nor were the handlers , according to the sources , averse to planting bombs in mosques . . . The objective was and is to create communal disturbances in the country . . . However , the sources did admit that there was no concrete proof , and any suggestion of Jaish involvement was ` just a conjecture . ' . . The agencies pin their hopes on the Hyderabad police 's input about the possible HuJI involvement . . . The bomb that went off was triggered from a mobile phone ; and , according to reports , the two defused bombs recovered from the Mecca Masjid should be able to provide a clue . Analysts believe that if confirmed these ` footprints ' should be able to provide the first major breakthrough to anti-terror investigators . . . For now , the Central agencies are probing the commonalities in the Hyderabad blast and the explosions in Delhi 's Jama Masjid in 2006 and in Malegaon in 2006 .
