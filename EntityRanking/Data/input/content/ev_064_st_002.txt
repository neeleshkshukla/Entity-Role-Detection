NEW DELHI : The terror attack on Mumbai trains was carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and local Students Islamic Movement of India -LRB- SIMI -RRB- activists and was designed to trigger communal conflagration in the country 's financial capital , intelligence sources said . While still waiting for clues to emerge , top intelligence sources in New Delhi seem pretty sure the blasts on the trains were plotted by Lashkar modules which are increasingly collaborating with activists of SIMI , which boasts of strong pockets of influence across Maharashtra . The estimate of intelligence agencies here is derived from the scale of the attack , as well as precise information about the Lashkar 's sleeper cells that have proliferated in Maharashtra . Sources in the home ministry , in fact , said that a carnage had seemed very much on the cards with information pouring in about stockpiling of arms and explosives by religious extremists . . . doweshowbellyad = 0 ; . . Bomb blast at Mahim railway station . -LRB- Mumbai Mirror -RRB- . .

Information as to which train they are going to attack and where is not easy to come by , ' said a top intelligence official engaged in counter-terror operations . Officials here are convinced that the terrorists ' objective was to cause communal mayhem in the city . The conviction is based on two facts . First , the trains were targeted just after the communal-tinged violence in Bhiwandi , and the protests by Shiv Sainiks over the insult to the statue of Meenatai Thackeray by miscreants .
