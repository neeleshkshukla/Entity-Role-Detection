TINSUKIA : Four persons were wounded grievously in a car bomb explosion by the proscribed ULFA in upper Assam 's Tinsukia district on Friday . The time-device fitted inside a vehicle exploded at around 7:30 am near the foodgrains wholesale market on busy Chamber road , the commercial hub of Tinsukia , police said . Eye witnesses said the vehicle was driven by a man to the area some time before the explosion occurred . The casualty would have been much higher had the bomb exploded two hours later when the market opened for business , the police said adding the area has been cordoned off . The injured have been shifted to nearby Assam Medical College hospital in Dibrugarh district , police said . This blast and another one inside the Food Corporation of India -LRB- FCI -RRB- gowdown premises in Guwahati yesterday could be linked to FCI NE Executive director P C Ram 's abduction by ULFA on April 17 , the police said . Essential food items from FCI are brought to Chamber Road market . ULFA has demanded Rs 21 crore for releasing Ram but has freed his driver . A car bomb was first used by the outfit to trigger an explosion in front of a police station in Guwahati early this year but none was injured in that incident .
