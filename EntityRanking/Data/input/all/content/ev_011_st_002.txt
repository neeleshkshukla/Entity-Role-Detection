Guwahati , June 23 : The banned National Democratic Front of Boroland ( NDFB ) has blamed the Bodo Liberation Tigers for Fridays rail blast , thereby accusing it of violating the ceasefire with the Centre . . . Denying its involvement in the explosion on the tracks on the Seshapani stretch in Kokrajhar district , the outfit also questioned the credibility of the administrations intelligence network . It is common knowledge that the area is dominated by the BLT . It is BLTs handiwork but the Kokrajhar administration put the blame on us , NDFBs self-styled captain B. Sudem claimed in a press note . . . The outfits allegation is likely to embarrass the BLT , also a signatory to the new Bodo pact that envisages a new administrative set-up with the creation of the proposed Bodoland Territorial Council . The Centre has pledged to approve the BTC Bill by August if required , by convening a special session of Parliament . . . Though there was no casualty in the blast triggered during heavy showers , 10 bogies of a goods train were derailed between Kakiragram and Sechapani . Train services were restored yesterday . . . The outfit also sought a judicial inquiry into the June 20 encounter deaths in Gossaigaon sub-division . . . The outfit refuted the armys claim that it had gunned down two of its activists Komal Basumatary and Mohesh Mochahary at Bongaon under Gossaigaon sub-division on Friday in an encounter and seized arms from them . Sudem alleged that the victims were farmers killed by the Army personnel from Sapkhata while they were working in their field .
