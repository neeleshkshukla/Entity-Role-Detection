Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : A 35-year-old man detained a couple of days ago at Bikaner in Rajasthan on suspicion of his involvement in the Samjhauta Express blasts was brought to Panipat in Haryana on Friday . . . However , he has not been formally arrested . . . According to the police , Salman was picked up from the house of a railway employee , Taj Mohammad , who vanished from the scene well before they mounted a raid at his residence . . . The police recovered over 20 bottles of kerosene and petrol from the house , following which they questioned Taj 's wife also . . . During interrogation , Salman purportedly disclosed that he belonged to Mumbai and had come to Bikaner about a month ago . . . While Salman is being interrogated by the Haryana police , the Bikaner police have launched a hunt for Taj . . . It is learnt that they have picked up one of his friends , identified as Chandra Shekhar , and are questioning him to know his whereabouts . . . The Delhi police have succeeded in identifying the factory where the suitcases used to plant the bombs were manufactured . Enquiries with the Delhi-based factory 's owner have revealed that the ` cheap quality ' suitcases are supplied to various parts of Uttar Pradesh , Haryana , Punjab , Rajasthan and some other southern destinations . Hence , the police are finding it difficult to zero in on the place from where the perpetrators would have bought the suitcases . The bottles containing the inflammable liquids used in the blasts have been found to have been manufactured in Andhra Pradesh . . . In view of the recovery of a torn piece of newspaper from one of the suitcases containing the unexploded bomb , the police are trying to find out if any Uttar Pradesh-based terrorist module was behind the blasts .
