A powerful blast caused serious damage to a foreign ministry building in the Libyan city of Benghazi on Wednesday , witnesses said . The explosion comes on the first anniversary of an attack by militants on the United States consulate in Benghazi , which killed four Americans , including the ambassador . It was not immediately known if the blast , which the witnesses said appeared to have been caused by a car bomb , had resulted in casualties . An AFP photographer said a large section of the foreign ministry building had been destroyed and parts of the nearby local headquarters of the central bank seriously damaged .
