Kerala People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) leader Abdul Nasir Maudany was on Friday taken by the Bangalore City police to Kodagu . Sources in the city police told The Hindu on Friday that a team of four officials left by road with Maudany . The team wanted to take Maudani to a place in Hosathota where they say the conspiracy to carry out the serial bomb blasts in Bangalore in July 2008 was hatched . It is at a ginger plantation at Hosathotha that Maudany is supposed to have met T. Nazir , the prime accused in the blasts in which a woman was killed and 20 were injured . The team wanted to investigate whether the plantation at Hosathotha was being used as a covert meeting place for hatching conspiracies . The police team with Maudany left Bangalore by road in the morning and reached Kodagu . Maudany and the team is expected to be back in Bangalore on Monday . Meanwhile , the city police have recorded the statement of 255 witnesses in relation to serial blasts . Since more than a dozen accused in the blasts are PDP members , the needle of suspicion was on Maudany , a senior police official on condition of anonymity told The Hindu . Sources said the two-day interrogation of Maudany had so far not revealed anything substantial .
