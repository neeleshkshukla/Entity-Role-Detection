At least five people were killed and more than 70 injured as seven bombs exploded here Sunday , six of them in and around the ground where BJP star Narendra Modi addressed a rally hours later . The first of the supposedly low intensity blasts ripped through a toilet at around 10 a.m. at the newly built Platform 10 of the railway station in the heart of the city , killing one person and wounding another . After an hour , by which time Modi had reached Patna but not the rally ground , four explosions took place inside the Gandhi Maidan , killing four others and causing a lot of panic , police and witnesses said . The Patna railway station is located two-three kilometres from the Gandhi Maidan . As smoke billowed at the blast sites , people ran in different directions . Witnesses reported seeing some of the rallyists falling on the ground , bleeding and in pain . Two more bombs went off just outside the Gandhi Maidan , one near a cinema hall and another close to the Twin Tower building complex . But no one died in these two places . Bihar 's Director General of Police Abhayanand confirmed the five deaths and said all the victims succumbed to their multiple injuries at the Patna Medical College and Hospital . A doctor at the hospital said eight of the injured were in very critical condition . The blasts at the Gandhi Maidan , where Modi later addressed a huge rally of Bharatiya Janata Party supporters , took place even as second rung party leaders were addressing the crowds ahead of Modi 's arrival . Modi 's meeting itself passed off peacefully , and the Gujarat chief minister made no reference to the bomb attacks . He , however , asked the BJP activists to disperse peacefully . Later , Modi said the bomb attacks were deeply saddening . He appealed for peace and calm . The bombings triggered alarm bells in New Delhi , where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh telephoned Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and asked him to order a speedy investigation and punish the guilty . The prime minister condemns the blasts which occurred at several places in Patna . He appeals to the people to maintain peace and calm , the Prime Minister Office 's said on Twitter . Minister of State for Home R.P.N. Singh said the attacks were extremely unfortunate and pledged to get to the bottom of this . He said the central government was in touch with the Bihar government , adding that the National Investigation Agency and National Security Guard had been rushed to Patna . In Bihar , all political parties including the ruling Janata Dal-United and those in the opposition -- Rashtriya Janata Dal , the Congress and Left parties -- condemned the deaths in the explosions . Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj said police recovered two live bombs from the railway station , one of which had a timer meant to go off at around 11 a.m. After the bombings , police appealed to people , particularly those gathered . . for the Modi rally , not to touch suspicious objects . Nitish Kumar cancelled a trip to Munger district and asked the chief secretary and the police chief to submit a report at the earliest . .
