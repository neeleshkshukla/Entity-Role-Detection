Sahanur Alam , a key accused in the Burdwan blast case , was arrested by the National Investigation Agency late on Friday night . Alam , who is alleged to be the financial brain of the terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) , was arrested in the Nalbari district of Assam in a joint operation by Assam Police and the National Investigation Agency or NIA . The NIA had been tailing Alam since his name surfaced in the call records and interrogation of Sajid , another accused in the October 2 blast at Khagragarh in Bengal 's Burdwan district . Although the investigating agency had last month arrested his wife , Alam had been on the run since the blast . NIA had also declared a reward of Rs . 5 lakh for anyone providing any information about him . Alam , alias Doctor , hails from Chatala village in Assam 's Barpeta district and is alleged to have arranged the money for the Indian modules of JMB . Two people were killed in the blast which was initially assumed to be a gas cylinder blast or explosion of crude bombs . However , investigations revealed that the two people who were killed were using fairly sophisticated improvised explosive devices or IEDs . Interrogation of two women arrested from the blast site revealed that a network of terror was spread across several districts in Bengal . OPEN
