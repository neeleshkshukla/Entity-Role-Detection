Death and destruction struck in the last quarter-mile of the Boston Marathon . Among the nearly 27,000 runners in the worlds oldest marathon , those making their way towards the final stretch of the 26.2-mile run may have felt nothing but a combination of exhilaration and exhaustion . Yet , as they approached the finish line at 2.45 p.m. on Monday the unsuspecting runners were violently hurled to the ground by the force of a powerful shockwave from coordinated twin blasts of shrapnel-spewing bombs . The blasts , which President Barack Obama described as a heinous and cowardly act ... of terror , left at least three persons dead and more than 176 injured . Speaking in a subdued but determined tone at the White House , Mr. Obama admitted : What we dont yet know , however , is who carried out this attack , or why ; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organisation , foreign or domestic , or was the act of a malevolent individual . He cautioned that people shouldnt jump to conclusions before we have all the facts . At a press conference on Monday night , the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was taking charge of the bombings probe . On Tuesday morning , The Boston Globe reported that the FBI had raided the Waters Edge apartment complex at 364 Ocean Avenue , fuelling questions about home-grown terror . OPEN
