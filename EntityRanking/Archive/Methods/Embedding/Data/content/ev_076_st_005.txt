BANGALORE : There 's a certain inevitability about it . It 's now almost a pattern that terrorists strike even before the nation recovers from its last shock , to leave it traumatized again.The target this time was Bangalore , the country 's IT capital , which has been in the terror shadow for long . The city became a target of eight serial blasts on Friday , leaving one dead , eight injured and the city scarred . The bombs were of low intensity , aimed more at dislocating economic activity than killing hundreds of people . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Only in May , 68 people were killed by terrorists in Jaipur . Even as the police was groping to identify the culprits there , terrorists cocked a snook at the security agencies , triggering eight serial blasts in 35 minutes at seven places during the busy lunch hour . -LRB- In Pics : Bangalore serial bomb blasts -RRB- The lone victim was Sudha , who was waiting at the Madivala bus stand .
