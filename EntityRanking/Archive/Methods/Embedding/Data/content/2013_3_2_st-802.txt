There has been no investigative breakthrough even a week after the terrorist attack in Hyderabad that killed 16 people and injured over 100 . Despite claims by the police of obtaining many clues , it appears to be still groping in the dark . No one has been arrested so far in connection with the twin bomb blasts , though police picked up for questioning many youth including some who were acquitted in 2007 Mecca Masjid blast . The multi-agency investigators have yet to establish identity the terror group behind the blasts . The terror attack in the crowded Dilsukhnagar area on Feb 21 evening killed 16 people and left 117 others wounded . Under fire for its failure to prevent the attacks despite admission by alleged operatives of the banned terror outfit Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) that they recceed Dilsukhnagar , the Andhra Pradesh Police may hand over the probe to National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) . A Delhi court on Thursday sent two alleged operatives of IM , lodged in Tihar Jail , to NIA custody for questioning . The NIA will question Syed Maqbool and Imran Khan for five days . The two were arrested late last year in 2012 Pune blasts case . NIA , which has already spread the probe to several states , is looking to piece together the information to track down the culprits . Since the blasts took place on the border between Hyderabad and Cyberabad police commissionerates , the police of both the commissionerates are probing the attacks besides Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) , Crime Investigation Department ( CID ) CounterIntelligence and Octopus , the antiterror wing of state police . The NIA , Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) and National Security Guard ( NSG ) are also participating in the investigations.IANS OPEN
