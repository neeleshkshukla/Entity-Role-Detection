Market blasts and other bombings across Iraq killed at least 33 people and wounded nearly 100 on Tuesday , spooking an already-rattled public . It also spurred security officials to clamp down on traffic as Shia Muslims brace themselves for more tragedy during pilgrimages towards the end of this week . The wave of morning bombings struck four cities , the worst hit being Diwaniyah , 130 km south of Baghdad , where an explosives-laden vegetable truck detonated in a crowded market , killing 25 people and leaving 40 injured . The attacks come as thousands of Shia pilgrims head to the holy city of Karbala this week for religious ceremonies that are expected to peak on Friday . Shia pilgrimages are a favourite target of Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda . It might be recalled that attacks timed to strike during a similar march in Baghdad last month left 100 dead . Diwaniyah is located about 40 km from Karbala , which also was hit by two bombs in cars parked outside a market in early-morning strikes that killed five people and wounded 30 . No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombings . AP OPEN
