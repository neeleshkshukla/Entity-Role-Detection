A bomb detection team of Rapid Action Force inspected the blast site at Thevaram here on Wednesday to identify the type of bomb which blew off at Thevaram on Monday , killing two persons . The team scanned the spot and interacted with local people . The team members showed some of the bombs brought with them from Coimbatore to the local people and a woman who saw the scrap vendor breaking the bomb on the road . After seeing the bombs , the woman informed that the blasted bomb was a little bit bigger . However , the team ruled out that the blasted bomb was Research Department Explosive ( RDX ) , said police sources . Trinitrotoluene ( TNT ) was used in it . Normally , when RDX goes off , it leaves a black powder-like substance at the spot . There was no such trace . They also confirmed that the bomb belonged to Defence services . It could be a misfired bomb . Such bombs blast only when they hit the target forcefully . The scrap vendor might have attempted to break the bomb , the police sources added . The police found the lot number when they scanned the bomb pieces recovered from the body of one of the deceased . The bomb was made in 1998 . The team met Superintendent of Police Praveen Kumar Abinapu and briefed him of the findings . OPEN
