The BJP also accused the state government of `` resisting '' a NIA probe.The Union Home Ministry had received reports from central agencies and the state government about the October 2 blast in which two suspected militants - Shakil Ahmed and Sovan Mandal - were killed and another man Hasan Saheb was injured.The state government , which appeared to be initially reluctant to accept that the incident in Burdwan had suspected terror links , handed over the case to the state CID after material collected from the blast site showed that a group was assembling bombs in the house and planning to carry out a strike.A large number of watch dials , SIM cards and other tools required to make improvised explosive devices were seized from the house where the blast occurred.Four persons , including two women , have been arrested so far in the case . .
