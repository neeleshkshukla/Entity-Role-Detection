By Prashant Pandey NEW DELHI , MAY 9 . Two crude bombs went off in quick succession in the highly sensitive area behind the South Block on Rajaji Marg - where the Sena Bhavan is located - and Dalhousie Road in New Delhi today leaving one person injured . The first bomb went off in the parking lot of the Army Headquarters canteen located opposite Gate No. 1 of the Sena Bhavan at about 3-07 p.m. Before the police could assess the damage , another bomb went off in a parking lot about 100 metres away on Dalhousie Road at about 3-14 p.m. . The bomb , which went off on the canteen premises , was kept on a bicycle carrier and was wrapped in a polythene bag . One person , identified as R.P.Sood , a civilian working in the Army canteen , suffered minor injuries . `` The blast was of very low intensity and no shrapnels were found . The explosive simply spread around the area leading to superficial injuries to a worker in the canteen , '' said the Deputy Commissioner of Police -LRB- New Delhi -RRB- , Mr. R. S. Krishnia , who rushed to the spot along with other senior police officials . The second bomb was hidden among a heap of leaves collected below a neem tree in the parking lot behind the South Block - which houses the Prime Minister 's Office , the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of External Affairs on Dalhousie Road . Nobody was injured . Police said some objects flew and landed some 10 metres away . However , there were very few Army vehicles in the parking space at that time and none were damaged . A timer-detonator , a nine-volt Duracell battery and a timer were recovered from the blast spots . Preliminary investigations revealed that the explosive used in both bombs were similar to the one found in the bomb discovered at the North Block on April 10 . The timers recovered from both spots today were ABCD timers , the type found in the bomb that was detected in the North Block . The explosive used was a nitrate-based compound . However , no group has claimed responsibility for the blasts . Though security of the area is under the Army , police said entry to the canteen did not involve any checking or frisking . Meanwhile , security in the entire area has been beefed up . Police have set up pickets around the area and checking of vehicles is on . `` We have also discussed the matter with the Army counterparts and they have decided to mount special security measures , '' said the Joint Commissioner of Police -LRB- New Delhi Range -RRB- , Mr. Suresh Roy . Police have registered two cases at Chanakyapuri and Parliament Street police stations . Investigations have been handed over to the Special Cell of the Delhi police , while the Army is also conducting parallel investigations . In the past one month , two bombs have been discovered in the high security New Delhi area . The first was found in the North Block on April 10 , while the other was discovered in a garbage bin in Connaught Place on May 2 . While there is no clue yet of the culprit in the first case , the police claimed to have solved the Connaught Place case by arresting an alleged ISI agent . . . By Prashant Pandey . .
