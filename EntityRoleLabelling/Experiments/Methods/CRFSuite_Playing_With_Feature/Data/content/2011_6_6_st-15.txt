At least 10 people were killed and double the number injured in a bomb blast at a bakery in the Nowshera area of the Khyber-Pukhtoonkhwa province on Sunday night . The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for planting the remote-controlled device in a dustbin at the entrance of the bakery . Since the bakery was located in a crowded market place , more casualties were feared , particularly since the bomb was activated during the Sunday rush-hour . The explosion also triggered a fire .
