They 're in a stateof trauma . We 're trying to cope . We 've never had such a devastatingemergency , '' said doctor T. Lotha at a private hospital in Dimapur treatingblast victims.Nagaland Chief Minister Neibhiu Rio said at least 26 people werekilled in the Dimapur blasts and another 86 were in hospital . `` The deathtoll may go up as many are in a very critical condition , '' he said . `` This is the worst ever terrorist strike in Nagaland . People arestill dealing with the shock -- they 're not yet thinking about who toblame . `` Mourners crowded churches across Nagaland , which is mostlyChristian , to pray for the victims.The blasts were the second major burst of violence in thenortheast since mid-August . Fifteen people , many of them children , werekilled in a rebel attack on an Independence Day parade in Assam August 15for which the United Liberation Front of Asom claimed responsibility.The armed insurgency in Nagaland began soon after much of thelocal population converted to Christianity . Many militant groups , seeking tosecede from India to form an independent Christian state , are funded andarmed by the Southern Baptist Church . Some of the groups such as theNational Liberation Front of Tripura have been involved in a campaign of `` gunpoint conversions '' and `` ethnic cleansing '' of native non-Christians , which has left over 50,000 dead and many more refugees over the past twodecades.Source : http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1503&ncid=1503&e=6&u=/afp/20041002/ts_afp/india_northeast_blast .
