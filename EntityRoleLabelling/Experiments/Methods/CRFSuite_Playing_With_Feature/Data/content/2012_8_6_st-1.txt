Their bodies were recovered from the Champabati river in Kokrajhar district on Sunday morning . After the news of their death spread , a mob blocked National Highway 31 at Bortol in Chirang district and threw stones at a bus of the Bodoland Transport Service , prompting the police and paramilitary forces to fire in the air to disperse them . Chirang Deputy Commissioner Puru Gupta said the driver , conductor and a passenger sustained minor injuries . Indefinite curfew was imposed again in the district . Additional Director-General of Police ( Special Branch ) Khagen Sarma said a low intensity blast occurred at Goreswar in Baksa district when a farmer , along with two others , was trying to operate a transistor which he found on a paddy field . The three sustained injuries . Police did not rule out the possibility of someone discarding the transistor with some circuit inside , perhaps due to the movement of security personnel in the area .
