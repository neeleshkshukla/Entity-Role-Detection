A series of blasts struck an area west of Baghdad on Saturday where day labourers gather to find work , as well as a music and clothes market in the capital , killing at least 15 people , officials said . The second day of major attacks this week in Iraq underscored the challenges still facing the security forces as they approach a particularly fragile time . All American troops are scheduled to be out of Iraq in a matter of weeks , leaving Iraqi security forces with sole responsibility for securing the country . Violence has ebbed across Iraq , but deadly bombings and shootings still occur almost daily as U.S. troops prepare to leave by the end of the year . Iraqi security officials maintain that they are fully prepared for the withdrawal , which is required under a 2008 security pact between the U.S. and Iraq . On Thursday , three bombs struck the southern city of Basra , killing 19 people . Earlier this week , the top U.S. general in Iraq , Lloyd Austin , said there would likely be some turbulence after American troops depart , as militants try to strengthen their positions . But he did not think there would be a wholesale disintegration of security . AP OPEN
