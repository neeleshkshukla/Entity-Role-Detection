A bomb attack killed at least six people outside a party political meeting in Pakistan 's troubled southwestern city of Quetta on Friday , police said . The bomb was detonated by remote control as the secular Pashtun nationalist Awami National Party ( ANP ) held a public meeting on the outskirts of Baluchistan province , which borders Afghanistan and Iran . `` The death toll in the blast has risen to six , '' local police official Wazir Khan Nasir said . He also added the bomb had been planted on a bicycle , adding that those killed in the attack also included a young girl while six others were wounded . Baluchistan is one of the most deprived areas of Pakistan where Baluch rebels rose up in 2004 , demanding political autonomy and a greater share of profits from the oil , gas and mineral resources in the region.AFP OPEN
