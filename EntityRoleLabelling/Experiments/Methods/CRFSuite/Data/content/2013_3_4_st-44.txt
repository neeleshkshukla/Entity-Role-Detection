As uneasy calm prevailed after the death of three anti-POSCO project activists in a bomb explosion in Patna village on Saturday , the Jagatsinghpur district administration resumed acquiring land on Sunday for the South Korean majors mega steel plant . The betel vines of three persons were torn down at Gobindpur without any resistance many residents had fled the villages fearing police action and Rs . 10.45 lakh was paid in compensation . We have destroyed three vineyards . Land acquisition will be carried out on a bigger scale in the coming days , Superintendent of Police Satyabrata Bhoi said . The administration said one person was seriously injured in Saturdays explosion . But the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti , which has been spearheading the movement against land acquisition , has urged all parties and rights organisations to carry out an independent investigation , charging the police with spreading a false propaganda over the deaths . The police claim that three persons lost their lives while preparing bombs is rubbish . In the past eight years of our struggle , we have never taken up arms . In fact , bombs were hurled at the three activists , who were in hiding for fear of police action . As heavy police deployment was made prior to the resumption of land acquisition , project supporters got excited and executed the fatal attack , PPSS president Abhaya Sahoo said .
