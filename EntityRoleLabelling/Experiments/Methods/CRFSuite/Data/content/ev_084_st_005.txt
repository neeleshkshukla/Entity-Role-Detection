Even as Maharashtra police investigators said little progress was made in identifying the perpetrators of Saturdays bombing of the German Bakery in Pune , an unknown Pakistan-based jihadist group has claimed responsibility for the attack that claimed 10 lives . . . Identifying himself as a spokesperson on behalf of a group calling itself the Lashkar-e-Taiba al-Almi , an individual using the code-name Abu Jindal said the bombing was carried out because of Indias refusal to discuss the Kashmir issue in the coming talks with Pakistan . . . Abu Jindal said he was calling from Miramshah in North Waziristan , and the telephone number used to make the call carried an area code common to the Waziristan tribal area and Bannu , the adjoining district in the North-West Frontier Province . When The Hindu tried calling back , though , a recorded voice message said the number was temporarily not in use . . . No past communiqu was issued by the Lashkar-e-Taiba al-Almi , and terrorism experts in New Delhi told The Hindu that no such group was known to exist . . . However , the caller who appeared to be educated said the group had split from the Lashkar-e-Taiba because it took orders from Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence . . . Earlier , al-Qaeda affiliated jihadist leader Illyas Kashmiri was reported to have sent an e-mail to a Pakistani journalist , claiming responsibility for the attack . . . Indian intelligence sources said the claims appeared intended to deflect attention from the Lashkar-e-Taiba , which is emerging as the principal suspect for the attack . In the wake of the Lashkars 2008 attack on Mumbai , Pakistan had come under intense pressure to dismantle the terrorist group as well as its political-religious organisation , the Jamaat-ud-Dawa . It has , however , rejected international calls for such action . Despite official claims , Maharashtra police sources say there is little evidence as yet to link the bombing of the German Bakery with any perpetrator .
