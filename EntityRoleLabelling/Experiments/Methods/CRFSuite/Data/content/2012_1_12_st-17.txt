Underlining the importance of fair trial and due procedure contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution even to a foreign national , the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the death sentence awarded to a Pakistani terrorist found guilty in the 1997 Delhi bomb blast case . Though the Bench , comprising Justices H.L. Dattu and C.K. Prasad , set aside the Delhi High Court judgment , the judges gave a split verdict in the case . Justice Dattu ordered a fresh trial , holding that the trial was vitiated as the appellant was not provided with a counsel to defend himself properly , while Justice Prasad held that the trial was illegal and directed him to be set at liberty and ordered his deportation .
