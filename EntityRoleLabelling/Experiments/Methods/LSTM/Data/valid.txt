to	O
the	O

of	O

a	O

that	O

that	O

First	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
Mujahideens	O

the	O

But	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O

couldnt	O

their	O

on	O

actual	O
18th	O

of	O
Babri	LOC_Others

points	O
to	O
some	O
definite	O
chinks	O

Clearly	O

the	O

The	O

the	O

of	O
a	O

the	O

its	O
historic	O

the	O
number	O
of	O

could	O
well	O
have	O
