who O

used O
a O
remote O
control O
device O
to O
detonate O
the O
improvised O
explosive O

devices O
( O
IEDs O
) O
. O
Our O
conjecture O
is O
a O
timer O
was O
used O
to O
explode O
the O
IEDs O
, O
but O
the O
possibility O

of O
using O
the O
remote O

device O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
, O
forensic O
experts O
remarked O

They O
are O
sure O
it O

is O
not O
akin O
to O
the O
TV O
remote O
control O
device O
, O
which O
is O
made O
with O
infra O
red O
technology O
. O
For O
this O

, O
the O
line O

sight O
joining O
the O
target O

the O
control O
device O
is O
compulsory O

are O
there O

that O
the O
radiofrequency O
signal O

adopted O

It O
can O
be O
operated O
from O

distance O

even O
500 O

of O
these O

in O
Bihar LOC_Others

And O
what O
a O
debut O
it O
was.Patna O
's O
historic O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
was O
packed O
to O
the O
brim O

with O
enthusiastic O
supporters O
who O
had O
travelled O
many O
hours O
from O
different O
parts O
of O
the O

had O
come O
in O
especially-arranged O
trains O

buses O
and O
had O
walked O
many O
miles O
to O
reach O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others

Many O
had O
made O
their O
own O
arrangements O

come O

and O
listen O
to O
a O
man O
who O
had O
so O
far O
been O
denied O
the O
opportunity O
to O
enter O
Bihar LOC_Others
by O
Chief O
Minister O
Nitish O

Kumar.The O
venue O
started O
filling O
up O
from O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
and O
by O
the O
time O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
Chief O
Minister O

arrived O
around O
1 O
pm O
, O
there O
was O
not O
an O
inch O
of O
free O
space.People O
had O
climbed O
onto O
roofs O
and O
terraces O
of O

high O
rise O
buildings O
adjoining O
the O
venue O
. O
They O
had O
even O
jumped O
onto O
Mahatma PER_Others
Gandhi PER_Others
's O
statue O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O

the O
ground.Every O
corner O
was O
taken O
. O
And O
as O
Modi PER_Others
was O
walking O
up O
the O
stage O
, O
an O
enthusiastic O
horde O
crashed O
through O

the O
barricades O
and O
entered O
the O
media O
enclosure O
and O
the O
VIP O
area O
. O
Chants O
of O
Modi PER_Others
, O
Modi PER_Others
filled O
the O
air O

, O
quite O
like O
the O
chants O
that O
rally O
for O
Sachin PER_Others
at O
the O
Wankhade O
Stadium.The O
crowd O
latched O
onto O
every O
word O
Modi PER_Others
spoke O

, O
quite O
like O
cricket O
fans O
would O
delight O
at O
every O
stroke O
Sachin PER_Others
played.There O
were O
multiple O
blasts O
near O
the O
venue O
of O
the O

rally O
just O
before O
Modi PER_Others
started O
speaking.At O
first O
they O
sounded O
like O
Diwali O
crackers O
being O
set O
off O
by O
enthusiastic O
supporters O
. O
But O

as O
news O
trickled O
in O
of O
casualties O
, O
tension O
gripped O
the O
air.Local O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
came O
on O
the O
microphone O
and O
tried O
to O

downplay O
the O
explosions O
and O
dismissed O
them O
as O
tyre O
blasts O
and O
firecrackers.The O
crowds O
were O
convinced O
that O
this O
was O
a O
conspiracy O
to O

ruin O
Modi PER_Others
's O
rally.On O
any O
other O
occasion O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
mad O
scramble O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O

venue O
and O
a O
stampede O
would O
have O
been O
highly O
likely.But O
despite O
the O
blasts O
, O
which O
saw O
dozens O
of O
injured O
being O
rushed O

to O
nearby O
hospitals O
, O
the O
crowds O
did O
n't O
move O
from O
their O
place.No O
mischief-maker O
was O
going O
to O
come O
between O
the O
crowds O

and O
Modi PER_Others
today.For O
the O
man O
himself O
, O
this O
rally O
was O
special O
. O
He O
had O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O
So O

far O
, O
coalition O
dharma O
had O
forced O
him O
to O
lie O
low O
and O
not O
respond O
to O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
's O
constant O
barbs O
against O

him.But O
today O
, O
there O
was O
no O
alliance O
compulsion O
to O
hold O
him O
back O
. O
And O
Modi PER_Others
let O
loose.He O
started O
off O
in O

Bhojpuri LOC_Others
, O
and O
a O
delighted O
crowd O
responded O
with O
wah-wah O
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
Bihari O
pride O
and O
how O
the O
state ORG_Others
government ORG_Others

had O
failed O
to O
create O
jobs O
and O
was O
forcing O
Biharis O
to O
travel O
to O
Gujarat LOC_Others
and O
elsewhere O
in O
search O
of O
employment.But O
the O

main O
target O
of O
Modi PER_Others
's O
speech O
was O
Bihar LOC_Others
chief O
minister O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
, O
a O
leader O
he O
derisively O
referred O
to O
as O

his O
friend.Modi O
called O
Nitish O
and O
opportunist O
and O
hollered O
: O
People O
ask O
me O
why O
my O
friend O
left O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O
I O

tell O
them O
those O
who O
can O
stab O
their O
guru O
Jai PER_Others
Prakash PER_Others
Narayan PER_Others
and O
Ram PER_Others
Manohar PER_Others
Lohia PER_Others
in O
the O
back O
can O
easily O

leave O
their O
long-time O
friend O
BJP ORG_Others

We O
sacrificed O
the O
chance O
of O
Sushil PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
Modi PER_Others
becoming O
the O
chief O
minister O
in O
favour O

of O
my O
friend O
( O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others

for O
the O
sake O
of O
clearing O
the O
` O
Jungle O
Raj O

in O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

Nitish PER_Others
did O
n't O
betray O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O
He O
betrayed O
the O
people O
of O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
, O

will O
you O
punish O
those O
people O
who O
betrayed O
you?This O
was O
BJP ORG_Others
's O
PM O
candidate O
Narendra PER_Others
Modi PER_Others
's O
first O
rally O
in O
Bihar.For O

the O
first O
time O
at O
a O
public O
rally O
, O
Modi PER_Others
highlighted O
his O
roots O
as O
a O
chaiwallah O
selling O
tea O
at O
a O
railway LOC_Others

platform LOC_Others
during O
his O
early O
days O
in O
Gujarat.In O
a O
deeply O
casteist O
society O
, O
Modi PER_Others
tried O
to O
play O
up O
his O
credentials O
as O

a O
backward O
leader O
who O
understood O
the O
pain O
of O
the O
impoverished O
, O
unlike O
Rahul PER_Others
Gandhi PER_Others
, O
who O
was O
to O
the O
manor O

born.Congress O
leaders O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
poverty O
and O
hunger O
are O
. O
I O
used O
to O
sell O
tea O
on O
trains O
. O
I O

know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
get O
onto O
trains O
and O
make O
a O
living O
. O
Even O
the O
railway O
minister O
does O
n't O

have O
my O
experience O
of O
the O
problems O
one O
faces O
on O
trains.Modi O
also O
tried O
to O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
Muslims O
of O
Bihar LOC_Others

and O
promised O
them O
development.Our O
Muslim O
brothers O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
are O
so O
backward O
. O
In O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
developing O

regions O
is O
Muslim-dominated O
. O
Let O
Hindus O
and O
Muslims O
together O
and O
work O
towards O
ending O
poverty O
. O
Our O
religion O
is O
India LOC_Others
first O

. O
We O
have O
to O
maintain O
peace O
and O
harmony O
at O
any O
cost.However O
, O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
's O
attempts O
to O
attract O
Muslims O
in O

large O
numbers O
to O
the O
rally O
did O
not O
materialise.Most O
people O
who O
came O
in O
trains O
, O
even O
from O
Muslim O
dominated O
areas O
like O

Kishanganj LOC_Others
, O
were O
Hindus.Muslim O
presence O
at O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
was O
minimal.Gandhi O
Maidan O
has O
seen O
massive O
rallies O

the O
past O

The O
historic O
rally O
of O

mega PER_Others
Garib PER_Others

of O
1995 O

, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
attracted O
a O
crowd O
of O
more O
than O
four O
lakh O
people O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O

the O
RJD ORG_Others
chief O
's O
popularity O
was O
at O
its O
peak O
in O
Bihar.The O
BJP ORG_Others
is O
claiming O
that O
the O
Hunkar O
Rally O
on O
Sunday O

smashed O
all O
previous O
attendance O
records.Estimates O
vary O
wildly O
. O
By O
conservative O
estimates O
there O
were O
about O
3 O
lakh O
people O
at O
the O
rally O

. O
The O
more O
exuberant O
among O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
say O
more O
than O
10 O
lakh O
people O
attended.The O
real O
number O
may O
lie O
somewhere O

in O
between O
. O
But O
make O
no O
mistake O
, O
Modi PER_Others
sent O
a O
strong O
message O
from O
Gandhi O
Maidan.No O
other O
leader O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others

today O
is O
capable O
of O
attracting O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
to O
a O
rally.Most O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
avoid O
the O
maidan O
to O

hide O
their O
inability O
to O
fill O
up O
the O
ground.Most O
of O
the O
people O
who O
attended O
Sunday O
's O
rally O
were O
youngsters O
. O
Many O

were O
first O
time O
voters O
, O
who O
seemed O
more O
attracted O
to O
the O
aura O
of O
Modi PER_Others
than O
they O
were O
to O
the O
policies O

of O
the O
BJP.Whether O
Modi O
can O
live O
up O
to O
the O
expectations O
that O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
built O
up O
is O
not O
known O

. O
But O
the O
youngsters O
who O
gathered O
at O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
seem O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leader O
has O
a O
magic O

wand O
with O
which O
he O
can O
cure O
India O
of O
its O
ills.They O
have O
heard O
of O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
development O
model O
and O
they O
think O

Modi PER_Others
can O
turn O
Bihar LOC_Others
into O
a O
land O
of O
milk O
and O
honey.Modi O
wanted O
a O
show O
of O
strength O
and O
he O
achieved O
that O

goal.But O
the O
real O
test O
is O
to O
see O
if O
Modi PER_Others
can O
convert O
the O
surging O
crowds O
at O
the O

into O
voters O
