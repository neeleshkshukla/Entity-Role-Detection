drop O
the O
idea O

Modi PER_Others
remained O
unmoved O

after O
a O
quick O
discussion O
with O
Gujarat LOC_Others

he O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
will O

proceed O
to O
the O
venue O
, O
address O
the O
rally O
in O
his O
usual O
flair O
, O
make O
it O

as O
if O
this O

business O
as O
usual O

It O
was O
again O
decided O
at O
the O

itself O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
on O
the O
podium O
in O

Gandhi LOC_Others

would O
handle O
it O
smartly O
, O
not O
allow O

of O

prevail O

keep O
telling O
the O

that O
these O
were O
only O
firecrackers O

would O
appeal O
to O
them O
not O
to O
burst O
them O
. O
. O
. O
The O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O

' O
assessment O
was O
that O
the O
low O

blasts O
at O
the O
railway O
station O
and O
at O
other O
points O
in O
and O
around O
Gandhi LOC_Others

The O
success O
of O
the O
Hunkar O
rally O
and O

the O
way O
Modi O
attacked O
Nitish PER_Others
during O
his O
one-hour O
speech O
has O
hugely O
dented O
Nitishs O
electoral O
prospects O
. O
Nitish O
will O
devise O
ways O

and O
means O
to O
fight O
that O
out O
politically O
, O
and O
first O
retaliation O
could O
be O
expected O
on O
30 O
October O
when O
he O
addresses O

a O
convention O
against O
communalism O
( O
a O
euphemism O
for O
a O
potential O
anti-Modi O

) O
in O

But O
then O

his O
capacity O
to O
respond O
effectively O
has O
seriously O
been O
challenged O
by O
the O
serial O
blasts O
. O
The O
states O
inept O
handling O
is O
sharpened O

by O
the O
fact O
that O
Nitish PER_Others

he O
came O

There O
is O
a O

near O
unanimity O
in O
their O
opinion O
that O
the O

has O
been O
a O
huge O
embarrassment O
for O
the O

, O

not O

it O
happened O
in O

because O

continued O

more O
specifically O
when O
it O

. O
The O
obvious O
reasons O
for O
going O
soft O
against O

that O

the O

that O
