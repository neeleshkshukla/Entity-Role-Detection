be O

If O

the O
methods O
used O
by O
terrorist O
since O
1993 O

2006 O
are O
analysed O
, O
one O
can O
see O
the O
trend O
that O
the O
attacks O

are O
becoming O
more O
sophisticated O
with O
precisely O
defined O
targets O
using O
the O
same O
old O
tools O
. O
The O
arrests O
of O
some O
terrorists O
in O

the O
recent O
past O
revealed O
that O
terrorists O
are O
recruiting O
people O
trained O
in O
engineering O
, O
science O
, O
medicine O
and O
management O
. O
. O

. O
A O
lot O
of O
technical O
and O
managerial O
knowledge O
is O
flowing O
in O
to O
the O
terror O
industry O
. O
It O
seems O
clear O
that O

at O
least O
the O
planning O
process O
is O
done O
by O
technical O
and O
managerial O
educated O
minds O
. O
. O
. O
In O
this O
scenario O
, O

the O
risk O
is O
very O
high O
that O
IT O
infrastructure O
and O
IT O
assets O
may O
be O
targetted O
in O
the O
future O
. O
This O
is O

one O
of O
the O
softest O
targets O
today O
, O
which O
can O
create O
maximum O
damage O
. O
. O
. O
Today O
, O
the O
application O
and O

implementation O
of O
IT O
controls O
many O
business O
processes O
of O

national O
strategic O
importance O

, O

transport O
, O
oil O
, O
manufacturing O
, O
banking O
, O
services O
, O
government-business O
, O
etc. O
. O
The O
security O
of O
these O
IT O
assets O

and O
IT O
infrastructure O
is O
far O
lower O
compared O
to O
the O
security O
of O
normal O
physical O
assets/infrastructure O
. O
Hackers O
, O
perpetrators O
, O
computer-criminals O

easily O
break O
into O
IT O
assets O
and O
create O
news O
. O
. O
. O
There O
are O
many O
methods O
available O
for O
terrorists O
to O
break O

into O
this O
IT O
infrastructure O
/ O
IT O
assets O
. O
I O
can O
discuss O
a O
number O
of O
these O
. O
But O
the O
irony O
is O

that O
this O
discussion O
of O
methods O
apart O
from O
creating O
awareness O
among O
masses O
, O
will O
also O
help O
terrorist O
get O
ideas O
. O
I O

refrain O
from O
discussing O
these O
methods O
as O
a O
better O
and O
socially O
secure O
option O
. O
. O
. O
Thus O
, O
it O
is O
the O

duty O
of O
all O
concerned O
business-process O
owners O
, O
whether O
in O
government O
or O
industry O
or O
utilities O
, O
to O
ascertain O
that O
their O
IT O

assets O
and O
infrastructure O
are O
reasonably O
secure O
. O
. O
. O
Security O
is O
not O
a O
one-time O
event O
. O
Security O
is O
a O
continuous O

process O
. O
Security O
is O
constant O
vigilance O
. O
Security O
is O
an O
ongoing O
fight O
between O
evil O
and O
our-protection-from-evil O
. O
. O
. O
Evil O

always O
finds O
new O
ways O
to O
attack O
us O
. O
So O
it O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
keep O
a O
constant O
vigil O
and O
keep O

upgrading O
the O
methods O
and O
technology O
of O
securing O
ourselves O
. O
Especially O
, O
when O
the O

had O

An O
analysis O

These O

raise O
suspicion O
if O
the O
tall O

wearing O
a O

white O

, O
who O
was O

always O
keeping O
his O
right O

in O

, O
used O
a O
remote O
control O
device O
to O
detonate O
the O
improvised O
explosive O

devices O
( O
IEDs O
) O
. O
Our O
conjecture O
is O
a O
timer O
was O
used O
to O
explode O
the O
IEDs O
, O
but O
the O
possibility O

of O
using O
the O
remote O
control O
device O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
, O
forensic O
experts O
remarked O
. O
They O
are O
sure O
it O

is O
not O
akin O
to O
the O
TV O
remote O
control O
device O
, O
which O
is O
made O
with O
infra O
red O
technology O
. O
For O
this O

, O
the O
line O
of O
sight O
joining O
the O
target O
and O
the O
control O
device O
is O
compulsory O
. O
Interestingly O
, O
chances O
are O
there O

that O
the O
radiofrequency O
signal O
technology O
adopted O
in O

to O
make O
remote O
control O
operations O
can O
be O
used O
to O
trigger O
a O
bomb O

. O
It O
can O
be O
operated O
from O
a O
distance O
of O
even O
500 O
meters O
if O
a O
high-quality O
transmitter O
and O
antennas O
are O
used O

, O
experts O
maintained O

Interestingly O
, O
so O
far O
police O
have O
not O
found O
any O
trace O
of O
evidence O
confirming O
that O
a O
timer O

was O
used O

Investigators O
are O

to O
find O

any O
of O
these O
