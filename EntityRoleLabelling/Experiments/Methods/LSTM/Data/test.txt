What O

his O

that O

thousand O

However O
, O
the O

said O
: O
He O
is O
a O
very O
cheerful O
guy O

and O
is O
recovering O
well O
but O
being O
young O
he O
was O
extremely O
conscious O
of O
the O
shrapnel O
injuries O
on O
his O
face O
and O
wanted O

to O
get O
rid O
of O
those O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
We O
told O
him O
the O
scars O
would O
gradually O
go O
away O
and O

the O
rest O
can O
be O
camouflaged O
with O
a O
beard O
. O
His O
entire O
body O
is O
covered O
with O
such O
shrapnels O
unlike O
other O
cases O

where O
shrapnels O
got O
lodged O
only O
in O
some O
body O
parts O
. O
The O
good O
thing O
about O
shrapnels O
is O
that O
they O
get O
sterile O

due O
to O
the O
extremely O
high O
temperature O
during O
the O
blast O
and O
hence O
pose O
no O
infection O
threat O
to O
the O
patient O
. O
There O

is O
no O
need O
for O
these O
splinters O
to O
be O
dislodged O
unless O
they O
are O
jutting O
out O
or O
they O
get O
lodged O
in O
an O

artery O

Usually O

a O
connective O
tissue O

around O
them O

they O

that O

Opposition O
to O
Indias O
democracy O
has O

long O
been O
a O
fundamental O
tenet O
of O
IMs O
ideology O
. O
IM ORG_Accused
argues O
that O
Indias O
secular O
democracy O
can O
not O
protect O
Indias O
Muslims O

from O
the O
Hindu O
majority O
. O
An O
attack O
during O
the O
current O
election O
period O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
not O
only O
disrupt O
the O

free O
and O
fair O
conduct O
of O
the O
elections O
, O
but O
also O
to O
trigger O
an O
avalanche O
of O
communal O
violence O
. O
For O
IM ORG_Accused

, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
self-fulfilling O
prophecy O
, O
giving O
them O
further O
impetus O
to O
spread O
their O
radical O
message O
and O
expanding O
their O

appeal O
. O
While O
IM ORG_Accused
radicalism O
has O
had O
only O
miniscule O
appeal O
to O
Indias O
Muslim O
population O
, O
a O
well-organized O
and O
sponsored O
terrorist O

group O
requires O
only O
a O
relatively O
small O
cadre O
to O
spread O
enormous O
havoc O
. O
. O
. O
Thus O
, O
disrupting O
all O
potential O
terrorist O

plots O
has O
been O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
Indian O
security O
establishment O
one O
that O
they O
have O
carried O
out O
spectacularly O
well O

In O
just O
the O

at O

five O
IM ORG_Accused

highly O

, O
and O
specific O

All O
of O
these O
had O
the O
potential O
to O
both O
exacerbate O

as O

The O

not O

between O

the O

of O

beyond O

a O
sign O
that O
greater O

called O
for O

Considering O

it O
would O
be O

that O

Beyond O

Expanding O

Improved O

an O

that O
