he O
apparently O
replied O
, O
` O
Because O
the O

are O
all O
based O

in O
Mumbai LOC_Event

' O
. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
a O
third O
senior O
police O
officer O
said O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O
, O

Gujarat LOC_Others
was O
merely O
the O
fig O
leaf O
cover O
. O
` O
Gujarat LOC_Others
today O
is O
being O
blamed O
for O
everything O
, O
' O
he O
said O

, O
` O
It O
is O
too O
simple O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
only O
motive O
is O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O
It O
is O
like O
saying O
that O

if O
Gujarat LOC_Others
did O
not O
happen O
then O
these O
blasts O
would O
not O
take O
place O
. O
But O
we O
know O
that O
would O
not O
be O

the O
case O
. O
These O
blasts O
are O
going O
to O
occur O
because O
the O
motive O
is O
far O
bigger O
. O
' O
. O
. O
. O

. O
There O
has O
been O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
revenge O
motive O
is O
being O
played O
to O
the O
hilt O
. O
When O
the O

blast O
occurred O
, O
Bhujbal PER_Others
's O
first O
reaction O
then O
was O
to O
blame O
the O
blasts O
on O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O
Reason O
: O
all O
the O

blasts O
had O
occurred O
in O
Gujarati-dominated O
areas O
such O
as O
Ghatkopar LOC_Others
and O
Zaveri LOC_Event
Bazar LOC_Event

The O

India LOC_Event
is O
an O
international O

symbol O

a O
favourite O

spot O
. O

. O
. O
. O
But O
as O
the O
police O
revealed O
, O
the O
explosive O
for O

the O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event
blast O
was O
placed O
inside O
the O

at O
Andheri LOC_Accused
East LOC_Accused
, O
from O
where O
the O
bus O
begins O
its O
run O
, O

and O
timed O
to O
explode O
later O
. O
It O
was O
just O
a O
coincidence O
that O
it O
happened O
to O
be O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event

And O
Zaveri LOC_Event

Bazar LOC_Event

one O

If O

the O
methods O

by O
terrorist O
since O
1993 O

2006 O
are O
analysed O
, O
one O
can O
see O
the O
trend O
that O
the O
attacks O

are O
becoming O
more O
sophisticated O
with O
precisely O
defined O

using O
the O

The O
arrests O
of O
some O

the O

revealed O
that O

are O
recruiting O
people O
trained O
in O

, O

and O
management O
. O
. O

. O
A O
lot O
of O
technical O
and O
managerial O
knowledge O
is O
flowing O
in O
to O
the O
terror O
industry O
. O
It O
seems O
clear O
that O

at O
least O
the O
planning O
process O
is O
done O
by O
technical O
and O
managerial O
educated O
minds O
. O
. O
. O
In O
this O
scenario O
, O

the O
risk O
is O
very O
high O
that O
IT O
infrastructure O
and O
IT O
assets O
may O
be O
targetted O
in O
the O
future O
. O
This O
is O

one O
of O
the O
softest O
targets O
today O
, O
which O
can O
create O
maximum O
damage O
. O
. O
. O
Today O
, O
the O
application O

implementation O
of O

many O

, O

, O
etc. O
. O
The O
security O
of O
these O
IT O
assets O

and O
IT O
infrastructure O
is O
far O
lower O
compared O
to O
the O
security O
of O
normal O
physical O
assets/infrastructure O
. O
Hackers O
, O

, O
computer-criminals O

easily O
break O
into O
IT O

and O
create O
news O
. O
. O
. O
There O
are O
many O
methods O
available O
for O
terrorists O
to O
break O

into O
this O
IT O
infrastructure O
/ O
IT O
assets O
. O
I O
can O
discuss O
a O
number O
of O
these O
. O
But O
the O
irony O
is O

that O
this O
discussion O
of O
methods O
apart O
from O
creating O
awareness O
among O
masses O
, O
will O
also O
help O
terrorist O
get O
ideas O
. O
I O

refrain O
from O
discussing O
these O
methods O
as O
a O
better O
and O
socially O
secure O
option O
. O
. O
. O
Thus O
, O
it O
is O
the O

duty O
of O
all O
concerned O
business-process O
owners O
, O
whether O
in O
government O
or O
industry O
or O

, O
to O
ascertain O
that O
their O
IT O

assets O
and O
infrastructure O
are O
reasonably O
secure O
. O
. O
. O
Security O
is O
not O
a O
one-time O
event O
. O
Security O
is O
a O
continuous O

process O
. O
Security O
is O
constant O
vigilance O

Security O
is O
an O
ongoing O
fight O
between O

and O
our-protection-from-evil O
. O
. O
. O
Evil O

always O
finds O
new O
ways O

So O
it O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
keep O
a O
constant O
vigil O
and O
keep O

upgrading O
the O
methods O
and O

The O

that O

. O
. O
The O
alert O
, O
according O
to O

reliable O

, O
was O
based O

could O
have O

back O

questions O
on O
what O
the O
actionable O
angle O
was O
in O

indeed O
turned O
out O

depend O

Compounding O

up O

a O

the O

? O
Police O

attribute O

this O
to O
three O

factors O

Firstly O
, O
a O
general O
disinterest O
among O
the O

, O

work O
following O
a O
soft O
stand O
adopted O
by O

towards O

for O
political O
reasons O
; O
insensitivity O
and O
ignorance O
of O

the O
police O
top O
brass O
towards O
the O
nature O
of O
counter O
intelligence O
work O
; O
and O
the O
general O
tendency O
of O
the O

to O
ignore O
the O

needs O
of O

who O
have O
been O

to O

The O

incident O
underscores O
several O
important O
points O
. O
First O
, O
it O
points O
to O
the O
substantially O
degraded O
capability O
of O
the O
Indian ORG_Accused
Mujahideen ORG_Accused
, O

a O
homegrown O
terror O
network O
that O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
this O
act O
in O
its O
trademark O
email O
, O
which O
was O
sent O
from O
Mallad LOC_Others

, O
Mumbai LOC_Others
. O
. O
. O
Although O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
is O
a O
chilling O
reminder O
from O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
that O
its O
still O
around O

, O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
outfit O
continues O
to O
be O
crippled O
, O
weak O
and O
disorganized O
since O
Indian ORG_Others
security ORG_Others
forces ORG_Others
broke O

its O
backbone O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
after O
a O
spate O
of O
bloody O
attacks O
across O
the O
country O
. O
. O
. O
There O

are O
three O
clues O
to O
the O
changethe O
timing O
of O
the O
blast O
, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
explosive O
device O
used O
and O
the O

modus O
operandi O
. O
. O
. O
First O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Mujahideens O
email O
, O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
was O
an O
act O
of O

retaliation O
against O
the O
demolition O
of O
the O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjid LOC_Others
( O
Mosque O
) O
back O
in O
December O
6 O
, O
1992 O
. O
But O
the O

fact O
that O
the O
perpetrators O
couldnt O
execute O
their O
work O
on O
the O
actual O
18th O
anniversary O
of O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjids LOC_Others
destruction O
on O
December O
6 O

points O
to O
some O
definite O
chinks O
in O
the O
IMs O
armour O
. O
Clearly O
, O
the O
terrorists O
were O
n't O
confident O
they O
could O
pull O

off O
a O
more O
symbolic O
attack O
on O
the O
actual O
day O
and O
so O
decided O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
. O
. O
. O
Second O

, O
the O
improvised O
explosive O
device O
( O
IED O
) O
used O
in O
the O
attack O
, O
which O
was O
hidden O
in O
a O
milk O
container O

, O
was O
a O
low O
intensity O
one O
and O
didnt O
have O
shrapnel O
or O
other O
projectiles O
like O
nails O
to O
maximize O
the O
kill O
quotient O

. O
The O
explosion O
did O
cause O
the O
tragic O
death O
of O
a O
toddler O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
nearly O
40 O
injured O

were O
able O
to O
escape O
with O
their O
lives O
. O
Had O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
been O
at O
its O
historic O
deadliest O
, O
the O
number O
of O

fatalities O
in O
Varanasi LOC_Event
could O
well O
have O
reached O
three O
figures O
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
thousands O
of O
devotees O
were O
present O
at O
the O

Sheetla LOC_Others
Ghat LOC_Others
( O
memorial O
) O
at O
around O
6:30 O
pm O
. O
In O
contrast O
, O
two O
explosions O
that O
rocked O
Varanasi LOC_Others
previously O
on O

March O
7 O
, O
2006 O
killed O
28 O
people O
. O
. O
. O
The O
single O
blast O
on O
December O
7 O
therefore O
makes O
it O
pretty O

clear O
that O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
's O
capabilities O
have O
been O
substantially O
eroded O
since O
March O
2006 O
. O
Cobbling O
together O
a O
crude O
device O
and O

hiding O
it O
in O
a O
milk O
container O
at O
a O
crowded O
religious O
place O
is O
n't O
rocket O
science O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
require O

specialists O
to O
plan O
and O
execute O
. O
. O
. O
This O
is O
the O
third O
attack O
by O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
since O
February O
, O
when O

more O
than O
a O
dozen O
people O
were O
killed O
in O
a O
German O
bakery-restaurant O
in O

and O
two O
Taiwanese O

were O
shot O
at O

in O
Old LOC_Others

on O
September O
19 O
, O
an O
act O
largely O
aimed O
at O
disrupting O
the O
Commonwealth O
Games O
. O
. O
. O
But O

this O
latest O
incident O
suggests O
IM ORG_Accused
executed O
a O
hurried O
and O
ill-prepared O
plot O
more O
to O
show O
their O
presence O
to O
their O
alleged O
Pakistani O

masters O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
Its O
probably O
their O
way O
of O
telling O
their O
believed O

in O

that O
they O
still O
have O

the O
guts O

gall O
and O
grit O
and O
could O
do O
better O
if O
they O
had O
more O

were O

veering O
around O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O

the O
possibility O
of O
a O

patch-up O
between O

Another O

that O
the O

required O
a O
fairly O
good O
network O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Others
as O

well O

He O
said O
it O

the O

a O

all O

to O
join O

Moreover O
, O
when O

Now O

this O

too O

try O
their O
best O
to O
conceal O
their O

as O
much O
as O

possible O
. O
. O
. O
Police O
sources O
say O
that O

will O

could O

be O
the O
handiwork O

one O

would O
mean O
that O
the O

will O
have O
go O
back O
and O

rely O
on O
age-old O
tactics O

the O

drop O
the O
idea O

Modi PER_Others
remained O
unmoved O

after O
a O
quick O
discussion O
with O
Gujarat LOC_Others

he O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
will O

proceed O
to O
the O
venue O
, O
address O
the O
rally O
in O
his O
usual O
flair O
, O
make O
it O
appear O
as O
if O
this O
was O

business O
as O
usual O
. O
It O
was O
again O
decided O
at O
the O
airport O
itself O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
on O
the O
podium O
in O

Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
would O
handle O
it O
smartly O
, O
not O
allow O
any O
kind O
of O
panic O

prevail O
and O
keep O
telling O
the O

that O
these O
were O
only O
firecrackers O

would O
appeal O
to O
them O
not O
to O
burst O
them O
. O
. O
. O
The O
BJP ORG_Others

' O
assessment O
was O
that O
the O
low O

blasts O
at O
the O
railway O
station O
and O
at O
other O
points O
in O
and O
around O
Gandhi LOC_Others

the O
Hunkar O

the O
way O

attacked O
Nitish PER_Others
during O
his O
one-hour O

has O
hugely O
dented O
Nitishs O
electoral O
prospects O

Nitish O
will O
devise O
ways O

and O
means O
to O
fight O
that O
out O
politically O
, O
and O
first O
retaliation O
could O
be O
expected O
on O
30 O
October O
when O
he O
addresses O

a O
convention O
against O
communalism O
( O
a O
euphemism O
for O
a O
potential O
anti-Modi O
front O
) O
in O
Delhi LOC_Others

But O
then O

his O
capacity O

respond O
effectively O
has O
seriously O
been O
challenged O
by O
the O

. O
The O
states O
inept O

sharpened O

by O
the O
fact O
that O

There O
is O
a O

near O
unanimity O

opinion O
that O

been O
a O
huge O
embarrassment O

not O

it O
happened O
in O
Patna LOC_Others

of O
the O

prime O
ministerial O

because O
of O

his O
continued O
handling O

terror-related O
issues O
with O

more O
specifically O
when O
it O
concerns O
the O

the O
Bihar ORG_Others

withheld O

which O
was O
being O
conferred O
on O
it O
. O
. O

. O
The O
obvious O
reasons O
for O
going O
soft O
against O
these O
terrorists O
and O
further O
investigations O
was O
that O
the O

would O
then O
have O

to O
proceed O
against O

men O
from O
the O

, O
picking O

up O

charging O

inviting O

the O

that O

LK PER_Others
Advani PER_Others

also O
spoken O

tell O
