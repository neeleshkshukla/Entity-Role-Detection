the O

were O
categorical O
in O

bringing O
to O

pointed O

the O

, O

was O
` O
indoctrinated O

in O
Dubai LOC_Accused
and O
returned O

on O

, O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
carrying O
out O

acts O
. O
On O
his O
return O
to O

India LOC_Event
, O
Hanif PER_Accused
contacted O
Ashraf PER_Accused

the O
duo O
began O
carrying O
out O
the O

, O
supported O
by O
Hanif PER_Accused

the O

were O
unwilling O

give O
a O

name O

even O
a O
hint O
. O
But O
the O
aforementioned O
officer O
said O
that O
as O
per O
their O
information O
, O
they O
believe O
that O

the O
Dubai LOC_Accused
centre O
that O
` O
indoctrinated O
' O
Hanif O
received O
instructions O
from O
an O
outfit O
in O
Saudi LOC_Others
Arabia LOC_Others
, O
which O
in O
turn O

was O
commanded O
by O
an O
outfit O
in O
Pakistan LOC_Others
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
This O
officer O
said O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
Lashkar-e-Tayiba ORG_Others

was O
not O
ruled O
out O
, O
just O
that O
it O
was O
more O
roundabout O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
what O
stands O
punctured O

is O
the O
so-called O
link O
between O
the O
Lashkar ORG_Others

SIMI ORG_Others
, O
a O
link O
that O
had O
political O
overtones O
. O
. O
. O
. O

. O
ASHRAF PER_Accused
told O

that O
they O

the O

affected O
Ahmedabad LOC_Others
, O
Vadodara LOC_Others

central O
Gujarat LOC_Others

, O
Surat LOC_Accused

peaceful O

So O
on O
what O
basis O
did O
Ashraf PER_Accused
claim O
to O
be O
affected O
? O
. O
. O
. O
. O

A O
second O
senior O
officer O
told O
rediff.com ORG_Others
that O
when O
Ashraf PER_Accused
was O
questioned O
why O
Mumbai LOC_Event
is O
being O
targeted O
if O
the O
motive O
is O

revenge O
for O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
he O
apparently O
replied O
, O
` O
Because O
the O
rich O
supporters O
of O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
government O
are O
all O
based O

in O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O
' O
. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
a O
third O
senior O
police O
officer O
said O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O
, O

Gujarat LOC_Others
was O
merely O
the O
fig O
leaf O
cover O
. O
` O
Gujarat LOC_Others
today O
is O
being O
blamed O
for O
everything O
, O
' O
he O
said O

, O
` O
It O
is O
too O
simple O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
only O
motive O
is O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O
It O
is O
like O
saying O
that O

if O
Gujarat LOC_Others
did O
not O
happen O
then O
these O
blasts O
would O
not O
take O
place O
. O
But O
we O
know O
that O
would O
not O
be O

the O
case O
. O
These O
blasts O
are O
going O
to O
occur O
because O
the O
motive O
is O
far O
bigger O
. O
' O
. O
. O
. O

. O
There O
has O
been O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
revenge O
motive O
is O
being O
played O
to O
the O
hilt O
. O
When O
the O

blast O
occurred O
, O
Bhujbal PER_Others
's O
first O
reaction O
then O
was O
to O
blame O
the O
blasts O
on O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O
Reason O
: O
all O
the O

blasts O
had O
occurred O
in O
Gujarati-dominated O
areas O
such O
as O
Ghatkopar LOC_Others
and O
Zaveri LOC_Event
Bazar LOC_Event
. O
The O
Gateway LOC_Event

India LOC_Event
is O
an O
international O

symbol O

a O
favourite O
tourist O
spot O

. O
. O
. O
But O
as O
the O
police O
revealed O
, O
the O
explosive O
for O

the O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event
blast O
was O
placed O
inside O
the O
bus O
at O
Andheri LOC_Accused
East LOC_Accused
, O
from O
where O
the O
bus O
begins O
its O
run O
, O

and O
timed O
to O
explode O
later O
. O
It O
was O
just O
a O
coincidence O
that O
it O
happened O
to O
be O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event
. O
And O
Zaveri LOC_Event

Bazar LOC_Event
is O
one O
of O
Mumbai LOC_Event

most O
important O
commercial O
areas O

an O
extremely O
congested O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
slip O
in O
and O
out O
without O
anyone O
noticing O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
police O
also O

Sources O
were O

veering O
around O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
underworld O
involvement O
was O
very O
high O
because O
of O
a O
host O
of O
factors O

. O
One O
official O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
underworld O
has O
been O
`` O
hyperactive O
'' O
in O
recent O
weeks O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O
There O

have O

a O
number O

attacks O
on O
Dawood PER_Others
Ibrahim PER_Others

. O
Among O
the O
recent O
inputs O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O

patch-up O
between O
some O
factions O
. O
Another O
analyst O
speculated O
that O
the O
simultaneous O
blasts O
required O
a O
fairly O
good O
network O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Others
as O

well O
as O
strong O
local O
support O
. O
He O
said O
it O
was O
likely O
that O
the O
blasts O
were O
executed O
by O
the O
underworld O
, O

financed O
by O
someone O
else O
. O
The O
attacks O
came O
just O
three O

a O

third O

the O

the O

long O
been O
a O
fundamental O

IM ORG_Accused
argues O
that O

Muslims O

from O
the O
Hindu O
majority O

An O
attack O

the O

not O

the O

free O

but O
also O
to O

For O
IM ORG_Accused

, O
this O
would O
be O

them O
further O

appeal O

While O
IM ORG_Accused
radicalism O
has O
had O
only O
miniscule O
appeal O
to O
Indias O
Muslim O
population O
, O
a O
well-organized O
and O

terrorist O

group O
requires O
only O
a O
relatively O
small O
cadre O
to O
spread O
enormous O
havoc O
. O
. O
. O
Thus O
, O
disrupting O
all O
potential O

has O
been O
a O

for O
the O

that O

True O
, O
the O
Red O
Fort O
may O
not O
be O
the O
fort O
it O
was O
under O
Shah O
Jehan O
. O
But O
it O
is O

still O
a O
symbol O
of O
India O
's O
power O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
the O
venue O
of O
the O
annual O
Independence O
Day O
address O
by O

the O
Prime O
Minister O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
army O
divisions O
are O
housed O
in O
the O
area O
and O
top O
officers O
, O
including O
those O

who O
have O
served O
recently O
in O
Kashmir O

in O
the O
huge O

It O
is O
also O
a O
bazaar O
and O
tourist O

spot O
, O
all O
rolled O
into O
one O
. O
What O
remains O
unclear O
still O
is O
whether O
the O
two O
militants O
, O
who O
sneaked O
into O

the O
Red O
Fort O
last O
Friday O
and O
killed O
three O
persons O
, O
including O
two O
soldiers O
, O
had O
a O
bigger O
agenda O
. O
Was O

their O
mission O
foiled O
by O
these O
intruders O
on O
their O
path O
? O
Perhaps O
they O
could O
have O
come O
with O
a O
bigger O
agenda O
to O

create O
panic O
in O
the O
national O
capital O
. O
But O
their O
brazen O
entry O
into O
the O
Red O
Fort O
and O
the O
gunning O
down O
of O

three O
persons O
were O
a O
clear O
signal O
to O
the O
Centre O
and O
meant O
a O
lapse O
in O
security O
as O
well O
as O
intelligence O
. O

. O
. O
The O
Delhi O
police O
have O
claimed O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
this O
case O
, O
with O
an O
encounter O
reported O
at O
Jamianagar O
in O

South O
Delhi O
in O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
Tuesday O
. O
One O
Pakistan O
national O
has O
been O
killed O
and O
another O
taken O
into O
custody O

, O
the O
authorities O
declaring O
both O
of O
them O
members O
of O
the O
Lashkar-e-Taiba O
. O
Following O
up O
on O
the O
weapons O
left O
behind O
by O

the O
militants O
at O
Vijay O
Ghat O
, O
the O
police O
raided O
a O
residence O
in O
Jamianagar O
, O
where O
these O
two O
militants O
were O
holed O

up O
. O
It O
is O
not O
certain O
yet O
whether O
they O
were O
the O
militants O
actually O
involved O
in O
the O
storming O
of O
the O
Red O

Fort O
or O
were O
only O
associates O
in O
the O
plot O
. O
Only O
a O
thoroughgoing O
investigation O
can O
provide O
insights O
into O
this O
daring O
operation O

. O
One O
thing O
is O
clear O
. O
The O
security O
and O
intelligence O
agencies O
have O
not O
yet O
learnt O
their O
lessons O
. O
Despite O
the O

Kargil O
affair O
and O
the O
Subrahmanyam O
committee O
report O
, O
there O
is O
just O
no O
coordination O
among O
the O
various O
agencies O
. O
It O
is O

perhaps O
the O
worst O
in O
Delhi O
, O
where O
the O
defence O
services O
function O
independently O
, O
the O
Intelligence O
Bureau O
and O
the O
RAW O
have O

their O
own O
show O
and O
the O
Delhi O
police O
watch O
helplessly O
until O
they O
are O
called O
in O
to O
take O
up O
the O
investigation O
. O

They O
could O
not O
enter O
the O
Navy O
Chief O
's O
residence O
or O
the O
Red O
Fort O
, O
until O
the O
Navy O

their O
time O

inquiry O

The O

explosion O
outside O
the O
highly-guarded O
15 O

comes O
barely O
eight O
months O
after O

Two O
Pakistan-based O
militant O
outfits O
have O

claimed O
responsibility O
for O
this O
explosion O

it O
is O
still O
not O
clear O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
suicide O
bomber O
in O
the O

car O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
blown O
up O
with O
a O
remote-controlled O
device O
. O
Whatever O
the O
impact O
or O
whoever O
caused O
it O
, O

the O
message O
is O
the O
same O
- O
a O
bid O
to O
defeat O
the O
ceasefire O
and O
abort O
the O
nascent O
peace O
process O
. O
If O

the O
Centre O
remains O
committed O
to O
pursuing O
peace O
, O
it O
must O
ignore O
these O
attempts O
and O
focus O
on O
strengthening O
both O
security O
and O

intelligence O
. O
Protecting O
monuments O

of O
India O

power O
like O
the O

figure O
high O

is O
equally O
important O

It O
may O

not O
be O
possible O
to O

it O
is O
about O
time O

be O

would O
mean O
that O

will O
have O
go O
back O

rely O

what O

was.Patna O

historic O
Gandhi LOC_Others

was O
packed O
to O
the O

with O
enthusiastic O

had O
so O
far O
been O
denied O
the O
opportunity O

Bihar LOC_Others
by O
Chief O

Kumar.The O
venue O
started O
filling O
up O
from O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
and O
by O
the O
time O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
Chief O
Minister O

arrived O
around O
1 O
pm O
, O
there O
was O
not O
an O
inch O
of O
free O
space.People O
had O
climbed O
onto O
roofs O
and O
terraces O
of O

high O
rise O
buildings O

the O
venue O

They O
had O
even O

at O
the O
entrance O

the O
ground.Every O
corner O
was O
taken O

And O
as O
Modi PER_Others
was O
walking O
up O
the O
stage O
, O
an O
enthusiastic O
horde O
crashed O
through O

the O
barricades O
and O
entered O
the O
media O
enclosure O
and O
the O
VIP O
area O
. O
Chants O
of O
Modi PER_Others
, O
Modi PER_Others
filled O
the O
air O

, O
quite O
like O
the O
chants O
that O
rally O
for O
Sachin PER_Others
at O
the O
Wankhade O
Stadium.The O
crowd O
latched O
onto O
every O
word O
Modi PER_Others
spoke O

, O
quite O
like O
cricket O
fans O
would O
delight O
at O
every O
stroke O
Sachin PER_Others
played.There O
were O
multiple O
blasts O
near O
the O
venue O
of O
the O

rally O
just O
before O
Modi PER_Others
started O
speaking.At O
first O
they O
sounded O
like O
Diwali O
crackers O
being O
set O
off O
by O
enthusiastic O
supporters O
. O
But O

as O
news O
trickled O
in O
of O
casualties O
, O
tension O
gripped O
the O
air.Local O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
came O
on O
the O
microphone O
and O
tried O
to O

downplay O
the O
explosions O
and O
dismissed O
them O
as O
tyre O
blasts O
and O
firecrackers.The O
crowds O
were O
convinced O
that O
this O
was O
a O
conspiracy O
to O

ruin O
Modi PER_Others
's O
rally.On O
any O
other O
occasion O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
mad O
scramble O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O

venue O
and O
a O
stampede O
would O
have O
been O
highly O
likely.But O
despite O
the O
blasts O
, O
which O
saw O
dozens O
of O
injured O
being O
rushed O

to O
nearby O
hospitals O
, O
the O
crowds O
did O
n't O
move O
from O
their O
place.No O
mischief-maker O
was O
going O
to O
come O
between O
the O
crowds O

and O
Modi PER_Others
today.For O
the O
man O
himself O
, O
this O
rally O
was O
special O
. O
He O
had O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O
So O

far O
, O
coalition O
dharma O
had O
forced O
him O
to O
lie O
low O
and O
not O
respond O
to O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
's O
constant O
barbs O
against O

him.But O
today O
, O
there O
was O
no O
alliance O
compulsion O
to O
hold O
him O
back O
. O
And O
Modi PER_Others
let O
loose.He O
started O
off O
in O

Bhojpuri LOC_Others
, O
and O
a O
delighted O
crowd O
responded O
with O
wah-wah O
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
Bihari O
pride O
and O
how O
the O
state ORG_Others
government ORG_Others

had O
failed O
to O
create O
jobs O
and O
was O
forcing O
Biharis O
to O
travel O
to O
Gujarat LOC_Others
and O
elsewhere O
in O
search O
of O
employment.But O
the O

main O
target O
of O
Modi PER_Others
's O
speech O
was O
Bihar LOC_Others
chief O
minister O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
, O
a O
leader O
he O
derisively O
referred O
to O
as O

his O
friend.Modi O
called O
Nitish O
and O
opportunist O
and O
hollered O
: O
People O
ask O
me O
why O
my O
friend O
left O
the O

I O

tell O

of O

for O

Nitish PER_Others
did O
n't O
betray O
the O
BJP ORG_Others

He O
betrayed O
the O
people O

I O
want O
to O

you O
, O

will O
you O
punish O
those O
people O
who O
betrayed O
you?This O
was O
BJP ORG_Others

first O

the O
first O
time O

his O
roots O
as O
a O
chaiwallah O
selling O
tea O
at O
a O
railway LOC_Others

platform LOC_Others
during O
his O
early O
days O
in O
Gujarat.In O
a O
deeply O
casteist O
society O
, O
Modi PER_Others
tried O
to O
play O
up O
his O
credentials O
as O

a O
backward O
leader O
who O
understood O
the O
pain O
of O
the O
impoverished O
, O
unlike O
Rahul PER_Others
Gandhi PER_Others
, O
who O
was O
to O
the O
manor O

born.Congress O
leaders O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
poverty O
and O
hunger O
are O
. O
I O
used O
to O
sell O
tea O
on O
trains O
. O
I O

know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
get O
onto O
trains O
and O
make O
a O
living O
. O
Even O
the O
railway O
minister O
does O
n't O

have O
my O
experience O
of O
the O
problems O
one O
faces O
on O
trains.Modi O
also O
tried O
to O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
Muslims O
of O
Bihar LOC_Others

and O
promised O
them O
development.Our O
Muslim O
brothers O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
are O
so O
backward O
. O
In O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
developing O

regions O
is O
Muslim-dominated O
. O
Let O
Hindus O
and O
Muslims O
together O
and O
work O
towards O
ending O
poverty O
. O
Our O
religion O
is O
India LOC_Others
first O

. O
We O
have O
to O
maintain O
peace O

any O

, O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
's O
attempts O
to O
attract O
Muslims O
in O

large O
numbers O
to O
the O
rally O
did O
not O
materialise.Most O
people O
who O
came O
in O
trains O
, O
even O
from O
Muslim O
dominated O
areas O
like O

Kishanganj LOC_Others
, O
were O
Hindus.Muslim O
presence O
at O
the O

was O
minimal.Gandhi O

which O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
attracted O
a O
crowd O
of O
more O
than O
four O
lakh O
people O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O

the O
RJD ORG_Others
chief O
's O
popularity O
was O
at O
its O
peak O
in O
Bihar.The O
BJP ORG_Others
is O
claiming O
that O
the O
Hunkar O
Rally O
on O
Sunday O

smashed O
all O
previous O
attendance O
records.Estimates O
vary O
wildly O
. O
By O
conservative O
estimates O
there O
were O
about O
3 O
lakh O
people O
at O
the O
rally O

. O
The O
more O
exuberant O
among O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
say O
more O
than O
10 O
lakh O
people O
attended.The O
real O
number O
may O
lie O
somewhere O

in O
between O
. O
But O
make O
no O
mistake O
, O
Modi PER_Others
sent O
a O
strong O
message O
from O
Gandhi O
Maidan.No O
other O
leader O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others

today O
is O
capable O
of O
attracting O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
to O
a O
rally.Most O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
avoid O
the O
maidan O
to O

hide O
their O
inability O
to O
fill O
up O
the O
ground.Most O
of O
the O
people O
who O
attended O
Sunday O
's O
rally O
were O
youngsters O
. O
Many O

were O
first O
time O
voters O
, O
who O
seemed O
more O
attracted O
to O
the O
aura O
of O
Modi PER_Others
than O
they O
were O
to O
the O
policies O

of O
the O
BJP.Whether O
Modi O
can O
live O
up O
to O
the O
expectations O
that O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
built O
up O
is O
not O
known O

. O
But O
the O
youngsters O
who O
gathered O
at O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
seem O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leader O
has O
a O
magic O

wand O
with O
which O
he O
can O
cure O
India O
of O
its O
ills.They O
have O
heard O
of O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
development O
model O
and O
they O
think O

Modi PER_Others
can O
turn O
Bihar LOC_Others
into O
a O
land O
of O
milk O
and O
honey.Modi O
wanted O
a O
show O
of O
strength O
and O
he O
achieved O
that O

goal.But O
the O
real O
test O
is O
to O
see O
if O
Modi PER_Others
can O
convert O
the O
surging O
crowds O
at O
the O
rally O
into O
voters O

One O

such O

that O
of O
37-year-old O

who O

thigh O
for O
removal O
of O
a O
foreign O
body O
, O
he O
is O
stable O
and O
recovering O

fast O
. O
What O
makes O
his O
case O
unique O
according O
to O
the O
doctors O
is O
that O
he O
had O
over O
a O
thousand O
pellet O
injuries O

with O
shrapnels O
embedded O
all O
over O
his O
body O
including O
his O
face O
. O
He O
was O
critical O
and O
admitted O
to O
the O
ICU O
, O

but O
has O
now O
been O
shifted O
to O
the O
emergency O
orthopaedic O
ward O
. O
The O
doctors O
attending O
them O
have O
been O
conducting O
surgeries O
to O

remove O
some O
of O
the O
splinters O
. O
However O
, O
the O
medicos O
admit O
that O
few O
pellets O
will O
remain O
inside O
the O
body O
as O

taking O
them O
out O
may O
prove O
to O
be O
risky O
. O
Dr O
Sunil PER_Others
Saxena PER_Others
said O
: O
He O
is O
a O
very O
cheerful O
guy O

and O
is O
recovering O
well O
but O
being O
young O
he O
was O
extremely O
conscious O
of O
the O
shrapnel O
injuries O
on O
his O
face O
and O
wanted O

to O
get O
rid O
of O
those O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
We O
told O
him O
the O
scars O
would O
gradually O
go O
away O
and O

the O
rest O
can O
be O
camouflaged O
with O
a O
beard O
. O
His O
entire O
body O
is O
covered O
with O
such O
shrapnels O
unlike O
other O
cases O

where O
shrapnels O
got O
lodged O
only O
in O
some O
body O
parts O
. O
The O
good O
thing O
about O
shrapnels O
is O
that O
they O
get O
sterile O

due O
to O
the O
extremely O
high O
temperature O
during O
the O
blast O
and O
hence O
pose O
no O
infection O
threat O
to O
the O
patient O
. O
There O

is O
no O
need O
for O
these O
splinters O
to O
be O
dislodged O
unless O
they O
are O
jutting O
out O
or O
they O
get O
lodged O
in O
an O

artery O
affecting O
blood O
flow O
. O
Usually O
, O
a O
connective O
tissue O
develops O
around O
them O
and O
they O
get O
encapsulated O
in O
the O
skin O

covering O
them O
, O
he O
added O

Aware O
of O
the O
possible O
difficulties O
of O
living O
with O
pellets O
, O
Dr O
Saxena PER_Others

If O

, O
we O
will O
provide O
such O

them O
as O
a O

Dr O

: O
His O
case O

is O
not O
disturbed O

in O
case O

a O

following O
a O
soft O
stand O

reasons O

insensitivity O

ignorance O
of O

the O
police O

towards O
the O
nature O
of O
counter O

; O
and O
the O
general O
tendency O
of O

to O
ignore O
the O

of O

that O

the O

said O

that O
the O
emphasis O
on O
the O

been O
reconnoitered O
reflected O
the O
assessment O
that O
the O

were O
under O
pressure O

to O
do O
something O
spectacular O
sooner O
than O
later O
and O
, O
hence O
, O
focussed O
on O
locales O

already O

refrained O
from O

in O
Rajya ORG_Others

that O
the O
calm O
professionalism O
of O
AP LOC_Others

cops O
was O
worth O
emulating O
. O
But O
many O
in O
his O
own O
ministry O
wondered O
whether O
cops O
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
carnage O
by O

upping O
their O
guard O
in O
response O
to O
a O
series O
of O
advisories O
. O
There O
was O
also O
puzzlement O
about O
the O
reasons O
why O
they O

failed O
to O
do O
so O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
terrorists O
had O
targeted O
the O
same O
spot O
in O
2007 O
. O
The O
last O
attempt O

failed O
only O
because O
the O
device O
planted O
by O
IM ORG_Accused
terrorists O
failed O
to O
go O
off O
, O
sparing O
the O
locality O
the O
devastation O
caused O

by O
the O

According O
to O
sources O
, O
one O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
the O
fatigue O
among O

over O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
same O

kind O
of O

over O

. O
The O

incident O
underscores O
several O
important O
points O
. O
First O
, O
it O
points O
to O
the O
substantially O
degraded O
capability O
of O
the O
Indian ORG_Accused
Mujahideen ORG_Accused
, O

a O
homegrown O
terror O
network O
that O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
this O
act O
in O
its O
trademark O
email O
, O
which O
was O
sent O
from O
Mallad LOC_Others

, O
Mumbai LOC_Others
. O
. O
. O
Although O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
is O
a O
chilling O
reminder O
from O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
that O
its O
still O
around O

, O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
outfit O
continues O
to O
be O
crippled O
, O
weak O
and O
disorganized O
since O
Indian ORG_Others
security ORG_Others
forces ORG_Others
broke O

its O
backbone O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
after O
a O
spate O
of O
bloody O
attacks O
across O
the O
country O
. O
. O
. O
There O

are O
three O
clues O
to O
the O
changethe O
timing O
of O
the O
blast O
, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
explosive O
device O
used O
and O
the O

modus O
operandi O
. O
. O
. O
First O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Mujahideens O
email O
, O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
was O
an O
act O
of O

retaliation O
against O
the O
demolition O
of O
the O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjid LOC_Others
( O
Mosque O
) O
back O
in O
December O
6 O
, O
1992 O
. O
But O
the O

fact O
that O
the O
perpetrators O
couldnt O
execute O
their O
work O
on O
the O
actual O
18th O
anniversary O
of O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjids LOC_Others
destruction O
on O
December O
6 O

points O
to O
some O
definite O
chinks O
in O
the O
IMs O
armour O
. O
Clearly O
, O
the O
terrorists O
were O
n't O
confident O
they O
could O
pull O

off O
a O
more O
symbolic O
attack O
on O
the O
actual O
day O
and O
so O
decided O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
. O
. O
. O
Second O

, O
the O
improvised O
explosive O
device O
( O
IED O
) O
used O
in O
the O
attack O
, O
which O
was O
hidden O
in O
a O
milk O
container O

, O
was O
a O
low O
intensity O
one O
and O
didnt O
have O
shrapnel O
or O
other O
projectiles O
like O
nails O
to O
maximize O
the O
kill O
quotient O

. O
The O
explosion O
did O
cause O
the O
tragic O
death O
of O
a O
toddler O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
nearly O
40 O
injured O

were O
able O
to O
escape O
with O
their O
lives O
. O
Had O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
been O
at O
its O
historic O
deadliest O
, O
the O
number O
of O

fatalities O
in O
Varanasi LOC_Event
could O
well O
have O
reached O
three O
figures O
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
thousands O
of O
devotees O
were O
present O
at O
the O

Sheetla LOC_Others
Ghat LOC_Others
( O
memorial O
) O
at O
around O
6:30 O
pm O
. O
In O
contrast O
, O
two O
explosions O
that O
rocked O
Varanasi LOC_Others
previously O
on O

March O
7 O
, O
2006 O
killed O
28 O
people O
. O
. O
. O
The O
single O
blast O
on O
December O
7 O
therefore O
makes O
it O
pretty O

clear O
that O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
's O
capabilities O
have O
been O
substantially O
eroded O
since O
March O
2006 O
. O
Cobbling O
together O
a O
crude O
device O
and O

hiding O
it O
in O
a O
milk O
