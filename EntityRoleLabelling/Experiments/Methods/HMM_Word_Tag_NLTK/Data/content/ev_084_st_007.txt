As Union Home Secretary G K Pillai confirmed that David Coleman Headley , arrested by the FBI for plotting a major terror attack in India at the behest of the Lashkar-e-Toiba , had visited the country , including Mumbai , several times , official sources said the government has now decided on prior clearances for visas to American citizens of Pakistani origin . . . Sources said that Headley , a Pakistani national who acquired US citizenship after changing his name from Daood Gilani , travelled to India on business visas nine times between 2006 and 2009 . . . And Pillai , responding to queries from reporters today , said : `` We do know that Headley had visited India a number of times . That is being investigated ... He has been in Mumbai and some other places . '' . . Security agencies are looking into Headley 's visits to `` several cities '' and say it is too early to say whether these were linked to the 26/11 terror strike in Mumbai . . . Official sources said Headley was suspected to have set-up an extensive network , particularly in Maharashtra , Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh , using the cover of a businessman . . . Although the government is awaiting the return of Intelligence officials who had gone to interrogate Headley and his associate Tahawwur Hussain Rana , alarm bells are already ringing in the internal security establishment with immigration records being dug out to get hold of the full picture . . . As a first step , the government , sources said , will inform the Americans that visas to its nationals of Pakistani origin will only be given after prior clearances . The government believes that Daood Gilani deliberately acquired a Christian name and American passport to avoid detection in India . . . Headley was arrested last month at Chicago 's O'Hare airport as he prepared to board a flight to Philadelphia , intending to travel to Pakistan .
