Acting on a complaint filed by the sister of death row prisoner Sarabjit Singh that alleged fraudster Manjeet Singh was behind the 1990 bomb blasts in Pakistan , the Punjab State Human Rights Commission on Monday sought a report from the State government . The Commission directed the State 's Home Department to file the report by March 3 , the next date of hearing in the case . Dalbir Kaur , sister of Sarabjeet who is facing death sentence in Pakistan for a string of bomb blasts in 1990s , has filed the complaint . Ms. Kaur , a resident of Bhikiwind village in Tarn Taran district , through her counsel alleged that the Jalandhar Police were giving VIP treatment to Manjeet against whom criminal cases had been registered . The enlarging of Manjeet on bail is a violation of human rights as my brother Sarabjit is a convict in Pakistan . In fact , Manjeet had committed the offence for which Sarabjit was made a scapegoat , Ms. Kaur said in her complaint to the Commission . - PTI OPEN
