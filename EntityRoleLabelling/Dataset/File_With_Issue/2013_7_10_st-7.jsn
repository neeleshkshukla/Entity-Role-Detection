Advani during his visit to Tirumangalam in Tamil Nadu in 2011 . Hanifa , who was hiding in his native village , was brought to Thirumangalam and produced in the Tirumangalam judicial magistrate court on Monday . He was remanded in judicial custody till July 22 . The Bangalore Central Crime Branch police confirmed Hanifas arrest , stating that they would seek his custody for questioning in connection with the Malleswaram blast case . Hanifa is the 12th accused to be arrested in Malleswaram blast case so far . Earlier , Hanifa had been arrested on charges of murdering a member of a pro-Hindu organisation and was jailed in 2009 . After he came out on bail , Hanifa was again arrested as one of the accused in a communal clash in Tamil Nadu in which six persons were killed . Hanifa who managed to get out on bail in the same year , had been absconding since his name surfaced again in the case of terror attack on Mr. Advani . A CCB official said there were four or five suspects who were still at large and efforts were on to track them down . Information so far revealed that Hanifa had played a crucial role in supplying explosives and to execute the terror attack .
