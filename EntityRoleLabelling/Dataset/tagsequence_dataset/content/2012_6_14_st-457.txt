A coordinated wave of car bombs struck Shia pilgrims in Baghdad and several other cities on Wednesday , killing at least 65 people and wounding more than 200 in one of the deadliest days in Iraq since U.S. troops withdrew from the country . The bloodshed comes against the backdrop of political divisions that have raised tensions and threatened to provoke violence that once pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war . No one immediately claimed responsibility though they bore the hallmarks of Sunni militants who frequently target Shias . The blasts were the third this week targeting the annual pilgrimage that sees hundreds of thousands of Shias converge on a golden-domed shrine in Baghdad 's northern neighbourhood of Kazimiyah to commemorate the eighth century death of a revered saint Imam Moussa al-Kadhim . The commemoration culminates on Saturday . Puddles of blood and shards of metal clogged a drainage ditch at the site of one of the bombings in the city of Hillah where , hours before , pilgrims had been marching . Soldiers and dazed onlookers wandered near the charred remains of the car that had exploded and ripped gaping holes in nearby shops . Most of the 16 explosions targeted Shia pilgrims in five cities ; two hit offices of political parties linked to the Kurdish minority in the tense North . Authorities had tightened security ahead of the pilgrimage , including a blockade of the mainly Sunni area of Azamiyah , which is near the twin-domed Shia shrine . In the Shia town of Balad , 80 km north of Baghdad , two nearly simultaneous car bombs killed seven pilgrims and wounded 34 . Explosions also targeted Iraqi Kurds in the north . One person was killed as three blasts rocked the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk . Another car bomb targeted an office of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani 's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in the northern city of Mosul , killing two people and wounding four . AP OPEN
