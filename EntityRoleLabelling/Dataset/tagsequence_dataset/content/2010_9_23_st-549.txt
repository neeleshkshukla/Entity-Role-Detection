A person who was injured in the police lathicharge on protesters at NCC thermal power plant site at Sompeta on July 14 succumbed on Wednesday , while a crude bomb mysteriously exploded in Mahalakshmi Hospital owned by Y. Krishnamurthy , president of the Paryavarana Parirakshana Sangham ( PPS ) . Both the incidents brought the situation to a boil once again in Sompeta and a bandh is being called by the PPS that spearheaded the agitation against the power plant . Dr. Krishnamurthy and another leader of PPS Bena Dhilli Rao suspected the hand of local Congress leader , P. V. Ramana and his supporters in the bomb blast . No one was injured in the explosion but the front elevation of the hospital and furniture was damaged in the second floor where the bomb was planted . Eye witnesses said the blast took place at 2.15 p.m. when Dr. Krishnamurthy was treating patients on the ground floor . Patients and medical staff ran out of the hospital . The 60-year-old Bendalam Krishnamurthy who was injured in the lathicharge was undergoing treatment at a hospital all this while and was discharged only a week ago . This pushes the death toll to three as two persons were killed in police firing on July 14 . The PPS leaders submitted a representation to the District Superintendent of Police Sanjay Kumar Jain urging him to conduct a thorough inquiry and to take stern action against those involved . People with the vested interests and supporters of power plant are trying to eliminate us physically . These incidents will not deter us and we will continue to fight against the power plant , said Mr. Dhilli Rao . Mr. Jain said experts from the forensic department will inquire into the incident . PPS leaders suspected one person called Ramana . We will conduct a thorough inquiry and take the inputs from the forensic department also , he told The Hindu . OPEN
