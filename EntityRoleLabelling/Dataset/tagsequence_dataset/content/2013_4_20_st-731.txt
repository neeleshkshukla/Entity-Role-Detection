Goas beaches were in the cross hairs of suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba terror suspect Nasir Raizuddin , being tried for the 2008 Bangalore serial blasts , Wikileaks has claimed citing a recently declassified U.S. diplomatic cable . The cable , dated February 2008 , was drafted by David T. Hopper , then consul general at the U.S. consulate in Chennai . Hopper quotes top police officials about other areas identified by Riazuddin before his arrest in Karnataka . According to Hopper , Raziuddin told the police that along with accomplices from the banned Students Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) , he had identified sites across the country for a series of bomb blasts . And beaches in Goa frequented by foreigners were one of those specifically identified as targets , according to the diplomatic communiqu . Goa has been put on high alert since the 26/11 terror strikes in Mumbai , mainly because the states beaches attract over 2.6 million tourists annually , of whom half a million are foreign nationals . The sizeable number of Israeli tourists to the state is another reason why security agencies believe Goa is on the terror radar . The Goa government has , however , consistently denied receiving any specific intelligence inputs of a potential terror strike.IANS OPEN
