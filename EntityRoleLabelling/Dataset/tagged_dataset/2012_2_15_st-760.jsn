    "content": "A man believed to be Iranian was seriously wounded when a device he was carrying exploded in one of a series of blasts in Bangkok on Tuesday , police said . The city has been on edge since the U.S. last month warned of a threat of a terrorist strike on tourist areas . Investigators rushed to the scene after three men were seen fleeing from a house where a blast was reported in a mainly residential area . One of the men hurled an explosive device at a taxi which refused to stop and later tried to throw another device at police , triggering a blast on the side of a busy road which tore off his legs , authorities said . An Iranian ID was found with the injured man so it 's likely that he 's an Iranian national , Major General Pisit Pisuthisak , deputy commander of Bangkok Metropolitan Police , told AFP by telephone from the scene . A police forensics team is examining the house . Police later used a high-pressure water cannon to defuse another device found inside the building . The injured man was admitted to a hospital . Police were searching for the two other suspects . Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra urged people not to jump to conclusions about the circumstances . Let the police and intelligence agencies do their work and the public must not panic because the perpetrator was detained , she told reporters during a visit to northeast Thailand . Thai police later charged a Lebanese suspected of planning an attack in Bangkok after they discovered chemicals at a property that could be used to make a bomb . Authorities alleged the Lebanese man had links to Hezbollah , an Iranian and Syrian-backed Shia group that is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by U.S. . The blasts came a day after bombs targeted Israeli interests in India and Georgia , injuring a diplomat and her driver in New Delhi . AFP Israel 's reaction AP reports from Jerusalem : Israel said the explosions in Bangkok were an attempted terrorist attack sponsored by Tehran . Defence Minister Ehud Barak stopped short of saying the man was trying to target Israelis . However , it came a day after Israel blamed Iran for attacks targeting Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia . And Mr. Barak 's comments made clear that Israel considers the attacks connected and sponsored by the Iranian government . Israeli officials believe Iran , and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah , are aggressively targeting Israelis to avenge years of setbacks that they blame on Israel . The attempted terrorist attack in Bangkok proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror , Mr. Barak said during an official visit to Singapore . The recent terror attacks are yet another example of this . Iran and Hezbollah are unrelenting terror elements endangering the stability of the region , and endangering the stability of the world , he added . OPEN",
