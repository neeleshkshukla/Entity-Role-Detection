The powerful bomb went off at the Phandu Baba shrine in Chamkani , a suburb of the provincial capital , late Saturday though there were no casualties . The blast caused extensive damage to the shrine . At least three shrines in Peshawar and Nowshera have been attacked since October 28 . On Friday , a bomb disposal squad had defused an improvised explosive device planted at the Mian Umar Baba shrine in the same village . On October 28 , four persons were killed and several others injured when a bomb went off at the Kaka Sahib shrine in Nowshera town . The attack was condemned by political parties and civil society groups . Hundreds of people blocked the Grand Trunk Road in Nowshera to protest the blast . No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks though the Taliban has been blamed for bombing shrines . The militants consider the practice of visiting shrines to be un-Islamic . PTI OPEN",
