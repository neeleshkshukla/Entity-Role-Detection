Police are attempting to defuse the explosive . 16:45 pm : Is violence part of plan to disturb states ? asks Mamata BanerjeeWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wondered if the violent acts were a game plan before elections to disturb states , regional parties and also to plan to murder some political leaders.I am shocked to know about the sad incident of bomb blast at Bodh Gaya today ( Sunday ) . What is our central government doing ? What about central agencies who usually interfere in state business but do not take care of safety and security of our people and country ? Banerjee said in a post on a social networking site.Is it a game plan before Lok Sabha elections to disturb states , regional parties and also to plan murder of some political leaders , so that nobody can raise the voice of people in future ? Or is it a blame game to avoid responsibility and to finish the regional political parties who are not dependent on the UPA ( United Progressive Alliance ) ? Banerjee added .16:30 pm : Bodh Gaya blasts not of high intensity , says Bihar Police chiefThe nine blasts at the Mahabodhi temple in Bihar 's Bodh Gaya town were not of very high intensity and therefore no damage was caused to the sanctum sanctorum , Bihar Police chief Abhayanand said.The explosions were not of high intensity ... somewhere between low and high intensity , Abhayanand said while addressing the media persons.No damage has been caused to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple , he added .16.00 pm : Centre tells states to tighten security at Buddhist shrinesThe Centre has directed all states to ensure fool-proof security at Buddhist shrines and Tibetan settlements in the wake of the continuing violence between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Myanmar.In an advisory to all states with special emphasis on cities like Delhi , Mumbai , Kolkata , Ahmedabad , Chennai , Bangalore , Hyderabad and Pune , the Home Ministry said adequate security must be provided to Buddhist shrines , Buddhist places of worships and Tibetian settlements.Citing recent intelligence inputs , the Ministry said radical terrorist groups were planning to target Buddhist installations , including Bodh Gaya , which was today rocked by serial blasts , injuring two monks.This is perhaps the first time that the Centre has issued an advisory about possible violence in the wake of the clashes in Myanmar . 15.48 pm : Nitish condemns blasts , seeks CISF security for templeBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar strongly condemned the serial blasts in and around Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya and demanded deployment of the Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) to protect the world famous Buddhist shrine.The serial blasts deserve strongest condemnation in strongest possible words as the perpetrators targeted the place of religious faith of crores of people with an aim to create fear among them , he told reporters after inspecting the blast sites at the Mahabodhi temple and surrounding areas in Gaya district with senior civil and police officials.Kumar , however , dismissed suggestions that there was any security lapse and said adequate precautionary measures were taken to beef up security measures at the Mahabodhi temple and surrounding areas in the wake of intelligence inputs . 15.15 pm : Protests in Nagpur over Bodh Gaya serial blastsA large number of supporters and followers of B R Ambedkar and others on Sunday staged a demonstration here to protest the serial blasts at the world famous pilgrimage town of Bodh Gaya in Bihar.Holding placards , banners and Panchsheel flags , the protesters gathered at the Reserve Bank square ( Samvidhan Chowk ) in the city and condemned the blasts.They shouted slogans and stopped vehicular traffic , which was then diverted from the square.Some Buddhists monks were also part of the demonstration , police and eye witnesses said . 14.47 pm : Security alert sounded at Indo-Nepal borderAn alert has been sounded on the Indo-Nepal border after nine serial explosions rocked the internationally renowned temple town of Bodh Gaya in Bihar.District Magistrate K V Pandiyan said police and Sashastra Seema Bal ( SSB ) have been alerted after the terror attack and they have been asked to maintain a vigil on the border . 14.08 pm : BJP criticises Nitish over Bodh Gaya bombingsTwo weeks after the 17-year-old alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal-United snapped , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) said the Nitish Kumar-led government has to answer why it did not take any action despite being warned that terror modules were planning to attack the 1,500-year-old temple annually visited by millions from across the world.BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said : We deeply condemn the dastardly attacks .
