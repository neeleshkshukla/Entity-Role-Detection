    "content": "Consequent to an appeal by community leaders to avoid big congregations and carrying bags and covers to the mosques , the turnout at the historic Mecca Masjid was very low on Friday , a day after two bomb blasts ripped Dilsukhnagar and resulted in 16 casualties . About 3,500 people offered Friday prayers at the mosque . With memories of Mecca Masjid blast revisiting the minds of the people , tension in the air was quite palpable in the Old City . As a precautionary measure the police heightened the security at the Mecca Masjid for Friday prayers . Bomb Disposal ( BD ) squads and police sanitised the mosque and its surrounding areas . Namazis were frisked before being allowed inside to offer prayers . The police did not allow people to park their vehicles in front of the mosque at the time of prayers . Though the markets were open , there was hardly any crowd due to the fear of blasts . Shopkeepers complained of low customer turnout during the day . The popular tourist places also sported a deserted look . The bandh call given by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) evoked little response in Old City and was limited to Lal Darwaza , Gowlipura and Uppuguda areas . Shops and commercial establishments here remained closed for most part of the day . Deputy Commissioner of Police , south zone , Tarun Joshi supervised the security arrangements . Speaking to media personnel Mr. Joshi said that security was tightened at the Mecca Masjid in view of the twin blasts at Dilsukhnagar on Thursday . He said that the police force was deployed in the Old City and the police are on high alert . With memories of Mecca Masjid blast revisiting the minds of the people , tension in the air quite palpable in the Old City OPEN",
