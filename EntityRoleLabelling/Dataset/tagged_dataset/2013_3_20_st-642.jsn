    "content": "A wave of bombings tore through the Baghdad area on Tuesday , killing 57 people on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion . The symbolism of Tuesdays attacks was strong , coming 10 years to the day that Washington launched the invasion with a shock and awe campaign of airstrikes on March 19 , 2003 before dawn the following day in Iraq . The military action quickly ousted Saddam Hussein but led to years of bloodshed as Sunni and Shia militants battled U.S. forces and each other , leaving nearly 4,500 Americans and more than 100,000 Iraqis killed . Tuesdays apparently coordinated attacks included car bombs and explosives stuck to the underside of vehicles . They targeted government security forces and mainly Shia areas , small restaurants , day labourers and bus stops over a span of more than two hours , according to police and hospital officials . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts , but they bore hallmarks of al-Qaeda in Iraq . The terror group , which favours car bombs and coordinated bombings intended to undermine public confidence in the government , has sought to reassert its presence in recent weeks . The violence started at around 8 a.m. Tuesday , when a bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in Baghdads Mashtal neighbourhood , killing four peopleThe deadliest attack was a 10 a.m. car bombing near the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in Baghdads eastern Qahira neighbourhood , which killed seven people . Underscoring the political tensions , Iraqs Cabinet also decided on Tuesday to postpone elections in two provinces dominated by the countrys minority Sunnis for up to six months . AP OPEN",
