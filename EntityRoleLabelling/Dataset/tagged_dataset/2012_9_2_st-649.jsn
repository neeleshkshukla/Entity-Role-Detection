    "content": "Two suicide attackersblew themselves up near a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday , killing at least 12 people , officials said . The attack around dawn in the town of Sayed Abad in Wardak province , about 70 km from Kabul , served as a reminder that even after a decade of fighting , tens of thousands of U.S. and foreign troops are still engaged in a war that shows no signs of slowing down despite the start of a withdrawal of coalition forces . The U.S.-led NATO coalition said no American or coalition troops were killed in the blasts . It confirmed that a number of troops were wounded , but did not say how many , in accordance with coalition policy . An official said one suicide bomber detonated a vest rigged with explosives outside a compound housing the district governors office , while another in a fuel tanker detonated his bomb on a road separating the compound from the base . He said the dead included eight civilians and four Afghan police . The Governors office said 59 people were wounded : Two NATO troops , 47 civilians and ten Afghan police officers . Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack , which he said was targeting the U.S. base . Last year , the same base in Wardak was the target of another suicide bombing . That blast which occurred on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States wounded 77 American soldiers and killed five Afghans . AP OPEN",
