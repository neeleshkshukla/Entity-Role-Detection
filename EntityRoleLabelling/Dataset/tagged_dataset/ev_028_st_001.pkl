Guwahati : A powerful blast near the Guwahati Central Jail at Fancy Bazaar , suspected to have been triggered by the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- , injured 13 persons . Fancy Bazar is the business hub of the northeast . . . Police had to use teargas shells and batons to disperse protesters angry at the failure of the district administration and police officials to prevent the blast . The mob pelted stones at policemen . The blast occurred around 11:30 a.m. when Fancy Bazaar was crowded . . . Fourth blast . . This was the fourth blast in the city and the third in the commercial centre in the past 15 days . Later traders and the local people took out a procession . Police suspect the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device planted in a rickshaw , which was blown to pieces in the impact . . . Security to be reviewed . . Kamrup -LRB- Metropolitan -RRB- Deputy Commissioner Abinash Joshi told reporters that the administration would review security measures . . . However , he said that people 's cooperation was essential to foil the evil designs of the militants and anti-social elements . . . ULFA 's charge . . Though ULFA did not claim responsibility , it issued a statement accusing the Purvottar Hindustani Sanmilan , a platform of Hindi-speaking people , of remaining a mute spectator to the ` atrocities committed by occupational forces on indigenous people . ' . . The outfit alleged that ` barring contributions made by a few individuals , Hindi-speaking people had always indulged in exploitation and looting and have not made any contributions towards protection of Assam 's identity and culture . ' . . Traders and residents in the area , where the blast occurred , mostly belong to Hindi-speaking communities .
