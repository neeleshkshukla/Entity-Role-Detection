    "content": "A bomb blast killed two top provincial officials on Friday in Thailand 's insurgency-plagued south , authorities said , a week after the kingdom held its first formal peace talks with rebels . The deputy governor of Yala province , Issara Thongthawat , was killed along with Yala permanent secretary responsible for security , Chavalit Krairisk , after a roadside bomb struck their vehicle , officials said . Issara , 56 , was rushed to hospital but later died , southern army spokesman Colonel Pramote Promin told AFP by telephone . He said the deputy governor appeared to have been targeted by militants while on his way to attend a local food fair . `` Explosive material was put inside a gas cylinder and hidden under the road , '' he said . `` His driver is still in critical condition . '' More than 5,500 people have been killed in nine years of bloodshed in Thailand 's Muslim-majority south near the border with Malaysia , with shadowy insurgent groups blamed for near-daily bombings and shootings . Security personnel and those connected with the government are regularly targeted , as well as Muslims perceived to be collaborating with the authorities.AFP OPEN",
