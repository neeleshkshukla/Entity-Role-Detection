VGUWAHATI , India ( AFP ) . . October 2 , 2004 . . Some 44 people were killed and 118 wounded in three nearly simultaneous bomb blasts Saturday morning in Dimapur , Nagaland 's commercial hub , in what a top official called the `` worst ever terrorist strike '' in the tiny state 's history . . . Gunmen in neighbouring Assam state later killed 15 villagers and injured a dozen more , police said . . . `` There were limbs everywhere and blood was splattered all over , '' said student leader T. Zheviho who was at crowded Dimapur railway station where one bomb exploded as passengers awaited a train . . . Two other bombs went off in the Hong Kong market , which sells Chinese goods , and an adjacent market . . . `` I had a miraculous escape , '' Zheviho told AFP by telephone from Dimapur , 70 kilometers ( 45 miles ) east of Nagaland capital Kohima . . . Police said the plastic explosive RDX appeared to have been used in the railway blast that created a huge crater beside a platform . . . `` We found a briefcase with fuse wires ... it contained RDX and a timer-device , '' V. Peseyie , Dimapur additional police chief , said . . . Seventeen more people were killed in a wave of attacks in neighbouring Assam , police said . . . Unidentified attackers raked shoppers with gunfire at a marketplace in Makri Jhora village , 290 kilometres ( 180 miles ) west of Assam 's main city of Guwahati , killing 11 and injuring about a dozen , police said . . . The same gunmen later shot dead four more villagers in a nearby forest , police superintendent L. R. Bishnoi told AFP . Two more people were killed and 10 injured in two blasts in the Assamese district of Bongaingaon , 220 kilometres ( 136 miles ) from Guwahati , Bishnoi said . . . One person was killed and seven wounded in an earlier bomb blast in Assam . . . Police also reported two other bombings in a village on the outskirts of Guwahati in which four people were injured . . . There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the day of bloodshed in the insurgency-infested northeast where some 30 guerrilla groups are battling for greater autonomy or independence . . . The attacks occurred as India marked the 135th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi who waged a campaign of non-violence to free the country from British rule . . . `` It is distressing such violence broke out on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , '' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in the capital New Delhi . . . Nagaland 's ill-equipped hospitals battled to treat the wounded . . . `` Many have multiple face and abdomen wounds . They 're in a state of trauma . We 're trying to cope . We 've never had such a devastating emergency , '' said doctor T. Lotha at a private hospital in Dimapur treating blast victims . . . Nagaland Chief Minister Neibhiu Rio said at least 26 people were killed in the Dimapur blasts and another 86 were in hospital . `` The death toll may go up as many are in a very critical condition , '' he said . . . `` This is the worst ever terrorist strike in Nagaland . People are still dealing with the shock -- they 're not yet thinking about who to blame . '' . . Mourners crowded churches across Nagaland , which is mostly Christian , to pray for the victims . . . The blasts were the second major burst of violence in the northeast since mid-August . Fifteen people , many of them children , were killed in a rebel attack on an Independence Day parade in Assam August 15 for which the United Liberation Front of Asom claimed responsibility . . . The armed insurgency in Nagaland began soon after much of the local population converted to Christianity . Many militant groups , seeking to secede from India to form an independent Christian state , are funded and armed by the Southern Baptist Church . Some of the groups such as the National Liberation Front of Tripura have been involved in a campaign of gunpoint conversions and ethnic cleansing of native non-Christians , which has left over 50,000 dead and many more refugees over the past two decades . . .
