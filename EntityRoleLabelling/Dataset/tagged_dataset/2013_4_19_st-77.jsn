    "content": "A special team of the Tamil Nadu police will inspect the scene of Wednesday 's bomb blast in Bangalore that left 16 people injured . The team comprising senior officers of the Special Branch CID will reach Bangalore on Friday and hold discussions with the investigators there and peruse available evidence and statements of eyewitnesses , police sources said . Soon after the incident on Wednesday , it was reported that a motorcycle with Tamil Nadu registration number was used to trigger the explosion . Though the registration number was found to be a fake one , the State police , relying on the input provided by their Karnataka counterpart , managed to track down the registered owner of the vehicle on the outskirts of Chennai . However , he claimed to have sold the motorcycle to someone else a few months ago . From then on , investigators came across several fake names , photographs and addresses . A couple of brokers who deal with used two-wheelers remember to have arranged the sale of the motorcycle . But the name , identity proof and address provided by them were found to be fake . It appears that the motorcycle changed a few handsefforts are on to zero in on the person who owned or used it last , a senior police official said . Meanwhile , it has been decided to visit the scene of blast to ascertain certain inputs . A few registration numbers were given to us by the Bangalore police . Most of them were found to be fake . In one case , the vehicle and the owner were found at the registered address ... it was obvious that he had nothing to do with the blast . The State police are working in close coordination with other agencies , the official said . OPEN",
