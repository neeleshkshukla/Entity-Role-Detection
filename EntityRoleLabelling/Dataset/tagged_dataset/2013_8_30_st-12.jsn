    "content": "Police Commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar on Thursday said that Yasin Bhatkal was involved in the 2010 Chinnaswamy Stadium bomb blast case here and a team would be sent to secure his custody for questioning . As many as 15 persons and six policemen were injured when two bombs exploded at the stadium where an IPL cricket match was to be played on April 17 , 2010 . Another unexploded bomb was found at one of the gates and defused by the police . Police investigation revealed that Yasin Bhatkal and his associates had come to the stadium and planted the bombs in the early hours . A policeman , who noticed them moving suspiciously , chased them away believing that they were rag-pickers . The police , who claimed to have pinpointed the Yasin Bhatkal modules involvement in the case , had traced it to Tumkur , where he and his associates were believed to have stayed for a day in a rented house and assembled the bomb . They were believed to have carried the bombs to Bangalore , according to Alok Kumar , Joint Commissioner of Police . Police believe that the bombs were fabricated in Tumkur as they were wrapped in a Kannada newspaper published from Tumkur and hence concluded that the bombs could have been fabricated in Tumkur . However , they could not identify the house . Now that Bhaktal is in custody , police investigators hope to identify the house and those who provided logistic support to Yasin . OPEN",
