Earlier this week , the key suspect Devendra Gupta , 36 , was nabbed in Ajmer . Chandrashekhar , suspected to be a key member of the terror module of a Hindu extremist outfit , Abhinav Bharat , was arrested on evidence indicating that he had been entrusted with supplying the mobile phone and SIM cards which were used for carrying out the bomb attack that killed three persons .
