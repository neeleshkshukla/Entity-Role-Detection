S"Karnataka , on Thursday , opposed granting bail to People 's Democratic Party leader Abdul Nasir Maudany , an accused in the Bangalore serial bomb blasts case , alleging that he masterminded the explosions . Opposing the bail application , Advocate-General Ashok Haranahally submitted in the Karnataka High Court that the accused had links with members of terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ) . It would not be safe to grant bail to such a person who is involved in terror activities as already most witnesses in the case are being threatened , Mr. Haranahally said . The accused appeared to have masterminded the blasts , as he was not only involved in the conspiracy but was also in constant touch with other the accused , some of whom were alleged to be LeT members and was continuously monitoring what was happening , the prosecution argued . It just can not be believed that he was not involved in the conspiracy . He was not only involved in it , he also harboured the accused , Mr. Haranahally contended . B.V. Acharya , counsel for Maudany , submitted that a person should not be made accused in a case on the basis of his past . There are no cases against the ISS ( now-defunct Islamic Sevak Sangh that Maudany had founded ) or the PDP that they were or are indulging in unlawful activities . He can not be accused of an offence on that basis , he submitted . Mr. Acharya further contended that the investigation had not been carried out in a fair manner and it was only a make-believe theory to implicate Maudany . Requesting that Maudany be granted bail , Acharya pleaded he would abide by any condition imposed by the court . Maudany has sought bail on the grounds that there was no prima facie case against him . Justice V. Jagannathan sought certain clarifications on the phone call records between the accused and the other accused and posted the case to Friday for further arguments . PTI OPEN"
