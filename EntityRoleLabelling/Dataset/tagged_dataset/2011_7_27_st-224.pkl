S'After preliminary investigations , the police found that the bomb that went off at Thevaram on Monday was of shell type . The pellets collected from the blast spot and from the body of the deceased were sent to Madurai for chemical analysis . We will know the exact nature of the bomb only after obtaining the report from the chemical lab , said Bodinayakkanur Deputy Superintendent of Police M. Kalifulla . Two persons were killed a when an unused bomb went off at fifth ward of Thevaram on Monday . Talking to press persons at Thevaram here on Tuesday , he said that one woman near her house saw the vendor breaking the bomb . We had collected pictures of various bombs to show her to identify the right piece . The list of ex-servicemen of this area too was taken to find out whether anybody disposed of it as scrap , he added . Investigation in different angles is on . While Superintendent of Police Praveen Kumar Abinapu inspected the blast spot this morning , Six special teams , including bomb detection and disposal squad , anti-terrorism squad and special intelligence wing camped in the town to collect samples and gather details about the blast . The police believed that the bomb could be a disposed bomb . Unused bombs might mingle with used shells at the time of disposal , they suspect . People were fond of collecting the empty shells to keep them in their houses as decorative pieces . OPEN'
