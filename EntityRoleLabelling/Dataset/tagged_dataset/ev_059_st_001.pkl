VFront Page Blasts in Delhi cinemas : one killed , 60 hurt . . Sandeep Joshi . . NEW DELHI : Explosions triggered by crude devices rocked two cinema halls here on Sunday evening during the screening of the controversial Hindi film , ` Jo Bole So Nihal , ' leaving one person dead and at least 60 injured . . . Following the blasts , a red alert was sounded in the capital . While the first explosion occurred at Liberty Cinema on the busy G. T. Karnal Road around 8.15 p.m. , the second one went off at Satyam Cinema in Patel Nagar 20 minutes later . One of those injured died at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital later , while the condition of 10 others was reported to be serious . . . Stampede . . In the first incident at Liberty Cinema , the explosive device was reportedly planted under a seat in the sixth row . The explosion , which ripped apart the seats and parts of the false ceiling , also touched off a stampede with people running helter-skelter in panic . Some of the injured were immediately rushed to a nearby private nursing home , while others were taken to the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya , the Hindu Rao , the Lohia and the Lady Hardinge Hospitals . . . The second bomb went off in the toilet of Satyam Cinema , injuring at least 10 persons and triggering off a commotion in the cinema hall . Most of the injured were rushed to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital . . . Soon after the explosions , there was chaos outside both cinema halls as the police cordoned off the area to carry out search operations . Relatives of those who had come to watch the movie frantically searched for their near and dear ones as no information was forthcoming . Some were in tears as they rushed from one hospital to the other in search of their family members and relatives . . . Among the first to visit Liberty Cinema were the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi , B.L. Joshi , the Delhi Chief Minister , Sheila Dikshit , and the Delhi Police Commissioner , K.K. Paul . Ms. Dikshit expressed serious concern over the law and order situation in the capital . The Lieutenant-Governor ordered an inquiry into the blasts . Later , Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil visited the Lohia Hospital and enquired about the condition of the victims . . . Security tightened . . Taking to presspersons outside Liberty Cinema , Mr. Paul said both the explosives were of a crude nature and did not contain any splinters . He said security has been beefed up . Investigations into the twin blasts were handed over to the Special Cell of the Delhi Police . . . Soon after the blasts , all the cinema halls in Delhi , Ghaziabad , Noida and Gurgaon , where the controversial movie was being screened , were evacuated and the night shows cancelled . The film was withdrawn from all cinema halls across Punjab last week following a ban call given by the highest religious body of the Sikhs the All India Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee . . . Blasts condemned . . UNI , PTI report : . . The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee -LRB- SGPC -RRB- condemned the blasts , calling them an attempt to disparage the Sikh image . ` These are dastardly , inhuman acts . We condemn them strongly , '' the SGPC general secretary , Sukhdev Singh Bhaur , said . . . Alert in Mumbai theatres . . Meanwhile , security at Mumbai 's cinema theatres exhibiting the movie has been tightened . Special police have been posted at more than a dozen theatres in the metropolis . . . The Joint Commissioner of Police -LRB- Law and Order -RRB- , Javed Ahmed , said that while extra staff had been posted at such theatres on Sunday , security measures would be tightened further from Monday . . . Police have been deployed at cinema halls in Pune also .
