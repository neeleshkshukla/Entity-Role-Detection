The police had shared the input with the agencies concerned almost nine months ago . . . Through an October 26 , 2012 release , the Special Cell announced Maqbools arrest in the Pune blasts case . It said he was a trainer in improvised explosive devices . He was tracked down to Hyderabad where he was arrested on October 23 last year . . . Based on the purported disclosures of other suspected IM members Asad Khan , Imran Khan , Sayed Feroz and Landge Irfan Mustafa the police had said the four , along with Maqbool , had planned to carry out a fidayeen attack at the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya in retaliation to the alleged atrocities being committed on Muslims in Myanmar . Their plan had the approval and support of Bhatkal brothers -LSB- alleged IM founders -RSB- . . . Pune blasts . . The Special Cell said Maqbool had taught Imran and Asad how to configure a bomb . In April 2012 , Imran introduced him to the Bhatkal brothers . Before the Pune serial blasts in August last , Maqbool , Irfan , Imran and Asad discussed their plan to target the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya , said the release , adding that since the Bhatkals wanted to avenge the death of Qateel Siddiqui -LRB- a terror suspect killed in Punes Yerawada Jail -RRB- , they decided to first carry out blasts in Pune . . . The police said Maqbool last year helped Imran in conducting a reconnaissance of Dilkushnagar , Begum Bazar and Abids in Hyderabad on a motorcycle . Incidentally , two blasts were triggered that claimed 18 lives in Dilkushnagar on February 21 . No arrests have been made in the case so far .",
