    "content": "The sulphuric acid and the explosives allegedly seized from the suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists who were arrested at Tughlakabad Extension here could be used for manufacturing improvised explosive devices similar to those configured by an old Lashkar hand Abdul Karim Tunda , now believed to be in Pakistan . Tunda , a homoeopathic practitioner , was considered to be an expert at manufacturing bombs using potassium chlorate/ammonium nitrate base and sulphuric acid . The sulphuric acid would initiate a chemical reaction triggering the indigenously made detonator leading to a blast in the explosives used in the configuration , said a police officer . Tunda , who had lost one of his hands while preparing a bomb , would usually configure the IED in a container wherein sulphuric acid would be kept separated from the base using a material that would gradually melt delaying the chemical reaction and consequent detonation . He and his men allegedly used such bombs in the 1990s . Sulphuric acid is also used in factory-made pencil timers where it melts a spring connected to a trigger , which when released hits the percussion cap of the detonator , causing detonation . The delay mechanism in the pencil timers is based on the density of the spring , said an expert . While the exact nature of the explosives seized from the LeT suspects is yet to be ascertained , it is learnt that the seized raw material was procured from the local market . The police have seized from them at least six memory cards that contain footages of one of the suspects undergoing training in the handling of weapons and explosives . One video clip demonstrates the process for configuring IEDs using easily available materials . OPEN",
