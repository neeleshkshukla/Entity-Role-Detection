    "content": "A powerful blast inside a house at Thillankery under the Iritty police station limits here on Sunday ripped off the house and left a youth seriously injured , raising suspicion that the explosion could have occurred while handling country-made bombs . The police said the people in the locality heard a huge sound of explosion at around 10 a.m. . The house where the explosion took place was at Iyyambode , near Thillankery , which is a politically sensitive area in the district . A youth identified as Roshith ( 22 ) , who the police described as a worker of the Democratic Youth Federation of India ( DYFI ) , sustained serious burns in the blast . After preliminary treatment at a hospital here , he was rushed to a hospital in Mangalore , the police said . The police said the youth suffered serious injuries on his left hand . He also sustained burns on his legs and face . The house with tiled roof , where he was staying with his parents , was completely damaged in the explosion . Both his parents were not at home when the explosion occurred . District Superintendent of Police Rahul R. Nair rushed to the area after the bomb explosion . Police personnel led by three Circle Inspectors conducted extensive raids in the area in search of explosives . When contacted , the district police chief told The Hindu that the preliminary inference of the police was that some explosive material kept at the house went off . It had to be confirmed by scientific report whether it was caused by gun powder or country-made bombs , he said . OPEN",
