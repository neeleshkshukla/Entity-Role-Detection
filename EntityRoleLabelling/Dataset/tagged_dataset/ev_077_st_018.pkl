VNew Delhi : The serial blasts in Ahmedabad came a day after the blasts in Bangalore . . . However , the similarities , many would say do not end there . In fact , the blasts in both the cities were of low-intensity and took place in crowded places . `` The blasts were of low intensity and similar to those which hit Bangalore , '' Union Minister of State for Home Sriprakash Jaiswal told reporters in Kanpur . . . And while the party top brass refused to comment on this similarity , both states - Karnataka and Gujarat - are ruled by the BJP . Advani refrained from commenting on whether BJP-ruled states were being targeted but demanded the Centre must have stringent anti-terror laws in place . . . BJP president Rajnath Singh blamed the UPA government for its `` soft approach '' because of which terrorists had grown bolder . . . He also took the government to task for repealing POTA and for `` sleeping over the anti-terror laws like GUJCOCA ( an anti-terror law adopted by the Gujarat Assembly ) '' . . . Reacting to his statement , Congress party 's chief spokesperson Veerappa Moily said , `` It is an irresponsible statement , not befitting the occasion . It does not befit a national leader to speak in that kind of tone . '' . . Police said at least 20 persons were killed and the deaths were reported from Vadilal Sarabhai , Civil and LG hospitals . . . Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil has convened a high level meeting on Sunday morning to review the security situation across the country . . . .
