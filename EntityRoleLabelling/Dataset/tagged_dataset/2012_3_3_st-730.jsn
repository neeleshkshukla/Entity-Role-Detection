Sending Chauhan to judicial custody , the court posted the case for further hearing till March seven . The NIA contended , in the in-camera proceedings , that Chauhan had revealed certain facts which further need to be investigated . The NIA told the court that Chauhan had travelled under fictitious names from Indore to Delhi and was also involved in planting of bombs on the train , CBI prosecutors R K Handa and Rajan Malhotra told reporters outside the court . The investigating agency also apprised the court that Chauhan had given Rs one lakh to another accused in the case , who is still absconding , Mr Handa said.PTI OPEN",
