S"Samajwadi Party leader Dilip Mishra , lodged in Agra jail in a murder case , was on Monday produced before a local court here in connection with the bomb attack on an Uttar Pradesh minister last week and remanded to 14 days ' judicial custody . Chief Judicial Magistrate Abdul Jaleel remanded Mishra and his associate Mahendra , a co-accused in the bomb attack case who was brought here from Badaun , to judicial custody till August 2 with the direction that both of them be lodged at the Naini Central Jail near here during this period . Both the accused had moved applications before the court claiming that they faced threat to their lives from the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party , following which the CJM also directed the district police to ensure their security . Mishra has been named as the main accused in an FIR registered in connection with the bomb explosion outside the residence of Minister for Institutional Finance and Judicial and Stamp Fees Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi on July 12 . One person was killed in the blast , while the minister , his gunner and a journalist were seriously injured . Old acrimony Mishra , who is also the president of Chaka block of the district 's trans-Yamuna region , has had a long-standing acrimony with the Minister . While Mishra has been lodged in Agra jail for quite some time for murder of his own security personnel , two of his aides actively involved in executing the blast were arrested here last week . The arrested duo during interrogation had allegedly confessed that the blast was carried out at the behest of Mishra and Mahendra and that a notorious sharp-shooter Rajesh Pilot had been hired for making the remote-controlled explosive device . Pilot is yet to be traced by the police . - PTI OPEN"
