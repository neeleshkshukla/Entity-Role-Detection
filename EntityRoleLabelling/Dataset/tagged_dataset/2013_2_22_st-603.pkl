S'A powerful car bomb exploded near the ruling Baath party headquarters in the Syrian capital on Thursday , killing at least 31 people , wounding dozens and leaving a trail of destruction , said a watchdog . Images of charred bodies lying next to mangled vehicles were broadcast by state television channel Al-Ekhbariya , which said children were among those wounded , as the blast occurred near a school the central Damascus district of Mazraa . At least 31 people were killed and dozens wounded , the majority civilians , said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , while the state news agency SANA reported 16 killed and 200 hurt in what it said was a suicide bombing . Shortly after the mid-morning blast , two mortars were fired at a military headquarters in Damascus , Al-Ekhbariya and the Observatory both reported , without giving information on casualties . The car bomb exploded at the 16 November Square near the Al-Iman mosque , next to the head offices of the Baath party , which has been in power for half a century . Buildings were shattered by the blast , which sent thick black smoke billowing across the capitals skyline and all roads in the area were quickly sealed off , an AFP correspondent said . Ambulance sirens rang out , and machinegun fire was also heard in the area , as firemen rushed to the scene to douse the flames . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack , which left a large crater in a major road , according to pictures released by the SANA state news agency . AFP OPEN'
