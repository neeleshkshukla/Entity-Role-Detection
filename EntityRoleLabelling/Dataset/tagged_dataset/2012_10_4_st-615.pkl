S'Four suicide car bombings rocked Aleppo on Wednesday killing at least 50 people , including several civilians , and injuring scores . State television beamed gory images of the victims some wrapped in bloodstained blankets following the bombings . The serial blasts targeted central Aleppos Saadallah al-Jabiri Square , close to a prominent hotel and an army officers club . The blasts tore down entire facades of buildings , virtually demolished some , and drove a deep crater on the road . Television pictures showed people pulling out bodies from the rubble . Shot dead State TV reported that two suicide bombers , wearing military uniforms , who had appeared on the scene after the attacks were shot dead before they could detonate their explosives . Wednesdays strikes took place a day after a section of the Lebanese media reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had ordered a fresh offensive in Aleppo , involving thousands of troops . Lebanons Al-Diyar newspaper said Mr. Assad had been flown by helicopter to Aleppo to personally supervise operations . Analysts point out that despite the heavy damage and the panic that it has caused , the latest string of bombings is unlikely to shift the scales of fighting in Aleppo , where reports have surfaced about the formation of peoples militias to counter foreign extremists who have deeply infiltrated the ranks of the opposition fighters .
