S'A High Court Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta and Justice G. Rohini on Monday restrained the State government from disbursing any further amount to the persons who were initially shown as accused in the Mecca Masjid bomb blast case . The Bench wondered on what provision of law such money was being paid . The Bench was dealing with a writ petition filed by Venkatesh Goud , who informed the court that initially some persons were shown as accused in the blast case and later charge-sheet was filed after thorough investigation . He lamented that later on a new agency took up the case and the government ordered payment of compensation . The case had not yet been finalised . The Bench pointedly asked why and under what provision of law such compensation was ordered in January 2012 . The Bench directed the government to file counter affidavit and made it clear that no more disbursement may be done . OPEN'
