    "content": "Police said on Sunday they were investigating two bomb blasts in Stockholm as an act of terrorism after an emailed threat over Sweden 's troops in Afghanistan . Police stopped short of saying Saturday afternoon 's blasts , which killed the suspected bomber and wounded two persons , were a suicide attack . A car blew up in a busy shopping area , followed minutes later by a second explosion nearby . Shortly before the blasts , Swedish news agency TT received a threatening letter referring to Sweden 's presence in Afghanistan and caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad drawn by a Swedish cartoonist . The letter included digital sound files with a recording in broken Swedish and in Arabic . The incident follows several nervous months in Europe after a U.S. travel alert about possible attacks by militants and a failed bid by a Yemen-based Al-Qaeda group to use air cargo to send parcel bombs via Europe to the U.S. German authorities last month said they were on guard against threats of armed attack on civilians of the kind that killed 166 people in Mumbai in 2008 . TT said the letter threatened attacks over Sweden 's presence in Afghanistan where it has 500 troops with the U.S.-led NATO force and the caricatures drawn three years ago by Swedish artist Lars Vilks . The news agency said the email it received was also sent to the Security Police . Our actions will speak for themselves , as long as you do not end your war against Islam and humiliation of the Prophet and your stupid support for the pig Vilks -LSB- the cartoonist -RSB- , TT quoted a man as saying . This is a very serious incident , which is being investigated as an act of terrorism , Anders Thornberg , director of operations at the Security Police , said in a statement . The police declined to go into further detail about the dead man 's motives or speak about his identity . Swedish broadcaster SVT , citing unidentified sources , said the dead man was thought to be a 29-year-old from the small town of Tranas , about 200 km southwest of Stockholm . As far as we know , it looks like he was working for himself , but we have to be really sure so we are investigating that there could be more perpetrators , Mr. Thornberg told Reuters . The Aftonbladet daily on Saturday quoted a source as saying the man was carrying six pipe bombs , of which one exploded , and a rucksack full of nails and suspected explosive material . Sweden did not raise its security threat level currently at elevated , two notches below the top level but police stepped up their presence in Stockholm . Britain , which has been targeted by similar attacks , said it was in touch with Sweden . Other European Capitals must be worried about the fact that this happened in a Capital city in the run-up to Christmas , said Claude Moniquet , head of the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center think-tank in Brussels . It could be a signal to other potential attackers to prompt them to attack at this time . Evan Kohlmann , a U.S. terrorism consultant , said he suspected the attack was a home-grown local extremist -- Reuters OPEN",
