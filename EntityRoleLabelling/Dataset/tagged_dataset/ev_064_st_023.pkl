VIt was a sea of white as mourners thronged crematoriums and funeral homes across Mumbai to bid a final goodbye to those who perished in Tuesday 's serial bomb blasts on suburban trains in Mumbai . . . Several localities in suburbs like Goregaon and Borivali were home to to many of the dead , and as their families , neighbours and friends made their way to condole the bereaved , an eerie silence prevailed over normally bustling neighbourhoods . . . ` What have they -LRB- terrorists -RRB- got by killing innocent college going boys ? We fail to understand their mentality , ' said one such mourner . . . Meanwhile , the BMC lent a helping hand and announced that all funeral services would be free of cost keeping in mind the scope of the tragedy that struck this teeming metropolis . . . Most of the people who lost their relatives , earlier heaved a sigh of relief as the identified bodies were handed over to relatives without any hassles after completion of due formalities . . . Even as relatives were busy preparing for the last rites , rain gods also joined them in the mourning , lashing occasional showers all during the day . .
