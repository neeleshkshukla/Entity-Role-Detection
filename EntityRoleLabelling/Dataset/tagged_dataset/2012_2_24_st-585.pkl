S'An explosion in a heap of garbage shattered windowpanes of several flats at Vidiya Colony of Miyapur on Thursday . While panicked residents mistook it for a bomb blast , police suspect it to be a cracker explosion . Municipal contract workers set fire to trash which they swept to a corner of an open plot abutting an apartment building -- NMR Residency around noon . As the waste-papers and dry grass burned , there was an explosion . Windowpanes of all the flats of NMR Residency facing the open plot and some apartments in adjacent complexes were shattered . None was injured though . I came rushing as my children study in a school here , Ahmed , a plumber from Rajaram Colony , said . He heaved a sigh of relief after finding that the explosion had nothing to do with the school . But students of the school said they felt like running away from their classes on hearing the massive sound . Owner of the open plot where explosion occurred , Sundeep , said the blast could be due to accidental ignition of some explosive materials left behind by contractors who laid an underground drainage pipeline in the area . I am told detonators or explosive substances abandoned by the contractors may have got mixed in the garbage . Unaware of it , the sweepers set it on fire , he said . Miyapur Inspector S. Bheem Reddy , however , maintained that all evidence at the spot proved the explosion occurred due to abandoned firecrackers . Will the explosion from leftover firecrackers be so powerful as to shatter windowpanes at a height of 50 feet ? It looks like heavy scrap was lying over the firecrackers which must have created high pressure , the Inspector reasoned out . Sniffer dogs , bomb disposal and CLUES team inspected the spot . OPEN'
