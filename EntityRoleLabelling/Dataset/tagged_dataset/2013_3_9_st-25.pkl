S'Facial features of one of the suspects who planted the bomb at Dilsukhnagar have now become clear after the quality of video footage obtained from two surveillance cameras in the vicinity were improved upon . The video had initially showed only blurred images . However , the police were yet to establish the identity of the person , DGP V. Dinesh Reddy told reporters on Friday . Mr. Reddy said two persons were spotted in one tape and a single person in the other footage , at the two blast sites . The face of one of the two , who were together , was now clear . It was not known whether the second person was the same as the one who figured in the tape at the other blast site . The DGP said the terrorists used two bicycles with white mudguards to carry the bombs . The surveillance cameras , one hung from a pole at the traffic junction and the other placed in a shop , captured their images . OPEN'
