    "content": "A spate of car bombings in Damascus on Thursday killed at least 83 people , including more than 60 in an attack near the headquarters of the ruling Baath party , a watchdog said . The most lethal attack , in central Damascus , was by a suicide bomber who detonated his explosives-laden car near the entrance of the Baath party 's main offices , said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . The majority of the 61 people who died in the powerful blast were civilians , including many children from a nearby school , the Observatory said on Friday , adding 17 were members of the security forces . The attack was the deadliest in Damascus since bombers first began targeting Damascus about a year ago . Twin suicide bombings killed 55 people in the Syrian capital on May 10 , 2012 . Another 22 people were killed in an apparently coordinated triple bombing targeting security headquarters in the northern Damascus district of Barzeh on Thursday , including 19 members of the forces , said the Observatory . Attacks have increasingly targeted government or security buildings in Damascus in recent months , many of them claimed by the jihadist Al-Nusra Front which the United States has designated as a `` terrorist '' group . Thursday 's attacks were condemned by both the regime and opposition as well as the United States , Russia and UN chief Ban Ki-moon . Elsewhere in Syria , 38 people were killed on Thursday in Daraa , cradle of the anti-regime revolt in the south of the country , including 18 in an air raid on a medical centre , the Britain-based Observatory said.AFP OPEN",
