S'A youngster from Assam working in a private company was critically injured when a blast occurred in his rented portion after leakage of cooking gas in MS Maktha opposite Raj Bhavan on Wednesday night . Twenty-one-year-old Mujbal Rahman sustained 40 per cent burns in the explosion . He was initially rushed to Yashoda hospital at Somajiguda and later shifted to Gandhi Hospital . Rahman wanted to prepare dinner and lighted a match stick not realising that his single room portion was filled with cooking as after leaking out from the cylinder . An explosion with big sound followed . Neighbours took him to hospital . Police bringing bomb disposal squads , sniffer dogs and forensic experts to ascertain facts and examine the scene triggered speculation if any anti-social elements were behind it . All the apprehensions about low or high intensity explosives being the reason for the blast were ruled out , West zone DCP G. Sudhir Babu said . OPEN'
