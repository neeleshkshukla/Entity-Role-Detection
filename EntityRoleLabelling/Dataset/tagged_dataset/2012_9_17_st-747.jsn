The blast took place in Jandol town , in the district of Lower Dir , 100 kilometres from the once Taliban-infested Swat Valley . `` It was a remote-controlled bomb blast which killed 14 people including three women and wounded 10 others , '' local police official Farman Khan told AFP . Khan , who was supervising the aftermath at the site , said the vehicle was targeted because it was carrying people known to be pro-government . There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Khan said militants were responsible.Another local police official , Javaid Khan , confirmed the incident and casualties . In 2009 , about 30,000 Pakistani troops went into battle against Taliban fighters controlled by Maulana Fazlullah , who for two years had terrorised people with a campaign of beheadings , violence and attacks on girls ' schools in Swat and parts of Dir . Dir borders the Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan.AFP OPEN",
