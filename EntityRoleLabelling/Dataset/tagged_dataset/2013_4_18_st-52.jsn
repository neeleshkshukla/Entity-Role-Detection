A team of the NIA and a bomb disposal squad of the National Security Guard have reached Bangalore . We are in constant touch with the Karnataka government and ready to offer any help , which is required , Minister of State for Home R.P.N. Singh told journalists here . Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde , who was in Kolkata to take part in the Eastern Zonal Council meeting , said the NIA would investigate the case . He was in touch with the State government and the police , he told journalists . Advisory to States Meanwhile , the MHA issued an advisory to all States asking them to beef up security and enhance deployment of police personnel , particularly in and around sensitive and crowded locations like places of worship , markets and malls . Sources in the MHA said Indian Mujahideen , which is allegedly responsible for recent blasts in Hyderabad and Pune , could be behind the Bangalore blast . Though it is too early to name any organisation , the evidence gathered so far by probe agencies indicates that it could be the handiwork of the Indian Mujahideen . The use of improvised explosive device and ammonium nitrate is what the banned outfit had used in the past as well , the sources said . OPEN",
