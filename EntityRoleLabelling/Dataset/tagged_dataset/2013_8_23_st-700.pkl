S'Two Iranian men were sentenced to between 15 years and life on Thursday for alleged involvement in a botched bomb plot last year in Bangkok that ended with one of them having his legs blown off . The pair , who had denied the charges , were among five Iranians suspected of involvement in blasts that Israel has linked to a 2012 spate of attacks on its diplomats across the world . Saeid Moradi ( 29 , in picture ) , who lost his limbs as he hurled an explosive device at police in the Thai capital , was found guilty on charges including attempted murder and handed a life term by the Bangkok Southern Criminal court . The court found him guilty of carrying explosives in public , using explosives to attempt to kill officials and using explosives which caused the destruction of property . AFP OPEN'
