    "content": "Three recent arrests by the National Investigation Agency may throw new light on the 2007 Samjhauta Express blasts , the May 2007 Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad and the Malegaon explosion in Maharashtra . Rajendra Chaudhary alias Samandar , who was arrested last week from Ujjain district of Madhya Pradesh , had allegedly planted explosives aboard the Samjhauta Express . The train blast claimed 68 lives on February 18 , 2007 . NIA sources said Chaudhary was also suspected to be behind the attack on Delhi University professor S.A.R. Geelani in February 2005 as well as involved in the killing of a witness in Madhya Pradesh in 2008 . Prof. Geelani , who was arrested and chargesheeted by the Delhi Police in the December 13 , 2001 Parliament House terror attack case , was acquitted by the Delhi High Court in October 2003 . Investigators see Chaudharys hand also in the murderous attack on the former RSS pracharak , Sunil Joshi , who was eliminated in December 2007 allegedly to put the lid on a conspiracy by Hindu extremist groups . The NIA arrested Tej Ram from Ujjain . He was suspected to have planted a bomb at the Mecca Masjid and carried out the explosion that killed nine people . The third person , Dhan Singh , arrested from Chitrakoot on the Uttar Pradesh-Madhya Pradesh border , is suspected to have been involved in the second blast at Malegaon in 2008 as well as in the Samjhauta blast . Chaudhary is believed to have told NIA investigators that he , along with Dhan Singh , Ramji Kalsangra and Amit alias Ashwini Chauhan , had planted bombs in Malegaon in 2006 in which 37 people were killed and more than 300 injured . Dhan Singh is also suspected to have planted the bomb in Malegaon in 2008 that killed seven people . The Malegaon blasts in 2006 , probed by Maharashtras Anti-Terrorism Squad , were blamed on nine Muslim men . The arrested men claimed that they had been framed . Most of them were freed on bail by court last year . Malegaon was chosen for bomb attacks twice as it has a sizable Muslim population . In 2011 , Swami Aseemanand admitted that radical Hindu and right-wing extremists were behind the 2006 blasts . He , however , retracted his confession . The NIA is on the lookout for Ramji Kalsangra , Amit and Sandeep Dange , who was a close associate of the slain Sunil Joshi . The investigators believe that the loosely-held module , comprising fringe elements of right-wing extremism , was also behind the blasts in Ajmers Dargah Sharif , the Mecca Masjid and the Samjhauta Express that provides a much sought-after rail link to Pakistan .
