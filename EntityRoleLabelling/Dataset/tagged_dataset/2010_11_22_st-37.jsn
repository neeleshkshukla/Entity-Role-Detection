When the villagers went to the field on Sunday morning , the bomb suddenly exploded , Mr. Singh told PTI . Twelve others who sustained splinter injuries were admitted to various hospitals in Deo and Aurangabad towns . One of them died later , police said . However , the deceased were yet to be identified as angry villagers did not allow the police to approach the field . Efforts were on to pacify the locals , police said . PTI OPEN",
