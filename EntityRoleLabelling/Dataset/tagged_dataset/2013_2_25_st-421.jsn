    "content": "Feroz Khan and Ali Bhai , presently imprisoned at the central jail here , are suspected to have links with the Indian Mujahideen operative Sayed Maqbul . They are the two high-security prisoners shifted here from Cherlapally in June , 2011 , following an attack on the prison staff there . In the aftermath of the Dilsukhanagar twin blasts , the police officials have started scrutinising the records of these two prisoners to check their antecedents and find out details of those who called on them . As per the records , nobody met Ali Bhai , who is a native of Zaheerabad and involved in seven cases of murder , kidnap , illegal arms and so on . But the second prisoner Feroz Khan , a native of Nizamabad , was visited by his brother Afzal Khan several times . Besides , one Maqbul met Feroz here on January 4 , 2012 by providing voter card as his identity . As per the voter card , he was a resident of Saidabad , Malakpet , Hyderabad . Meanwhile , Nellore Central Jail Superintendent M.R. Ravikiran rushed to Hyderabad on Sunday , which triggered speculation that investigating officers into bomb blasts asked him to bring records and details of the two high-security prisoners . But the jail authorities described the visit as an administrative one to attend a meeting of superintendents of all central and district jails in the State . As against rumours , there was no indication of the National Investigation Agency sleuths visit to the central jail here on Sunday to interrogate the two suspects . It is learnt that the NIA sleuths have not contacted the prison authorities for this purpose so far . Suspected IM operative Maqbul met Feroz by providing voter card as his identity . As per the voter card , he is a resident of Saidabad in Hyderabad OPEN",
