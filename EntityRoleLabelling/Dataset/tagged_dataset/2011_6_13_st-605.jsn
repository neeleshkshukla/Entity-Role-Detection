    "content": "Second blast kills rescue workers , journalist and policemen Over 30 people were killed and thrice the number injured in two blasts that ripped through the Khyber Super Market in Peshawar soon after midnight on Sunday . The dead include a journalist and a couple of policemen who had rushed to the spot after the first blast . According to the police , rescue workers , police and journalists had swarmed the site after the first blast . Within minutes , a second and larger explosion took place in the same area , which is within cantonment limits and includes both commercial and residential spaces . No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts . In fact , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) has denied any role in the twin explosions . The AFP quoted a TTP spokesman as saying it was an attempt by foreign secret agencies who are doing it to malign us . Further , according to the TTP , it targeted only the government and the military . The office of the political agent of the Khyber tribal agency and a residential complex of the Army are in the vicinity of the super market . Initially , there was speculation that the first explosion was caused by a transformer blast but the subsequent explosion that consumed lives established the handiwork of terrorists who have been increasingly targeting security facilities and their properties . Last Sunday , terrorists had targeted an Army-run bakery , killing , among others , a Major 's wife and child . Police said approximately 10 kg of explosive material had been strapped to a motorcycle parked near the complex . Preliminary investigations by the Bomb Disposal Squad indicate a suicide-bomber . Witnesses said a restaurant in the super market and several adjoining shops were badly damaged in the explosion , which also triggered a huge fire . OPEN",
