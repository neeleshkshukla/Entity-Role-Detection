    "content": "Sadhvi Pragya Thakur , one of the accused in the September 29 , 2008 , case of Malegaon bomb blasts that killed six persons and injured 100 , reportedly sought speedy trial and justice for her as she is already suffering from breast cancer and had a paralytic stroke recently . She conveyed this to social activist Swami Agnivesh when he met her recently at the Bhopal jail in the presence of its deputy superintendent . Swami Agnivesh told The Hindu that Ms. Thakur claimed that she was tortured by adopting third degree methods by the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) . She was ready to cooperate with the investigation agency , he said adding that the cases against her could be handed over to a fast track court considering her ill-health and also on humanitarian consideration . Ms. Thakur was initially arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad police along with Lt. Col. Purohit . A charge sheet was filed against her in 2009 alleging that Lt. Col. Purohit was the main conspirator who provided the explosives and she arranged for persons who planted the explosives . Later , the case was transferred to the NIA . The NIA is also probing Ms. Thakurs role in the Samjhauta Express train blast and some other cases . OPEN",
