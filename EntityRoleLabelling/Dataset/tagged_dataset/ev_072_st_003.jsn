    "content": "Barely three days after a blast at the Ajmer Sharif dargah , a powerful explosion rocked a cinema hall in Ludhiana on Sunday night - after peaceful Id festivities throughout the country - killing at least seven persons and injuring about 40 . A 10-year-old child was among those killed . . . Eyewitnesses however claimed there were two blasts in close succession , around 8.30 pm , just after the interval . . . The victims were mainly migrants from other states who were watching a 7 pm show of Bhojpuri film Janam Janam Ka Saath at Shringaar Cinema . There are two more cinema halls in the building . . . The condition of 23 of those injured , admitted to CMC Hospital , was stated to be serious . . . Ludhiana Range DIG Ishwar Singh said the bomb appeared to have been placed in the first three rows of seats . `` At the moment it can not be said if it was RDX or something else , '' he added . The blast site was splattered with blood and body parts and a huge crater marked the spot . . . The Union Home Ministry reacted with caution , saying it needed more information before concluding if this was a terror strike . `` We are monitoring the situation and waiting for more details , '' a spokesperson said . . . What is worrying the security and intelligence machinery is not just that the blast closely follows the Ajmer explosion but that if it were a terror attack , it would be the first such strike in Punjab in a long time and the very first for Ludhiana , the industrial city that also houses a large number of migrant workers . . . Investigators will also have to determine whether the blast is the handiwork of Islamist terror groups or if a dormant Punjab militant organisation has become active again . . . Former Punjab Director General of Police K P S Gill maintained that planting of explosive devices in a cinema hall meant that it was most likely a terror strike and his suspicions would go to the Babbar Khalsa International or the Khalistan Zindabad Force . . . ... contd .",
