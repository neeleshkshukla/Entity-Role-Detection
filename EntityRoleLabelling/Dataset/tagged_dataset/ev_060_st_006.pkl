VA bomber rammed an explosives-laden car into an army jeep Wednesday , sparking a blast that killed five soldiers and a civilian near a school in an elite neighborhood of Indian Kashmir 's capital , police said . At least 20 people were injured.No children were hurt inside the school in Srinagar , the summer capital of India 's Jammu-Kashmir state , senior police officer Hasseb Ahmed said.However , the blast knocked down some of the school perimeter and shattered windows in a neighborhood filled with residences of top government officials , Ahmed said.The crushed remains of the attack car lay on the leafy avenue near shreds of flesh and the bodies of soldiers . The severely damaged army jeep lay toppled on a side . Bits of the engine , metal and glass shards and other debris lay on the blood-splattered road.The body of the attacker had n't yet been found , but police believed it was blown to pieces . `` The earth shook and all the window panes were shattered . I was inside and I rushed out . There was smoke everywhere . I saw the bodies , '' an unidentified witness told the private Channel 7 . No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Pakistan-based Islamic militants have been fighting Indian security forces in the state since 1989 to carve out a separate homeland or merge the Himalayan region into Pakistan . More than 66,000 people have been killed in the conflict.India accuses Pakistan of aiding and arming the militants at training camps on the Pakistani side of Kashmir , a charge Islamabad denies.Both India and Pakistan claim the divided Himalayan region in its entirety and have fought two wars over it . . . .
