    "content": "NEW DELHI : The Jaipur terror attack evoked strong global outrage with countries condemning the blasts and pledging support to India in the fight against terrorism . US ambassador David Mulford , who met foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon , offered his country 's help in the investigations into the serial blasts . `` We have offered our assistance in analysing and understanding the aftermath of the tragedy . We told the government that we are willing to help them in any way we can , '' Mr Mulford said after the meeting . . .

Saying that there could be no justification for this kind of violence that took the lives of innocent victims , Britain joined other countries in condemning those behind the blasts . `` Bombings in Jaipur have shown again the horrific destruction which terrorism brings , '' British foreign minister David Miliband said . . . `` There can never be any justification for acts of indiscriminate violence such as these , and I utterly condemn those who have perpetrated today 's attacks , '' he said . He further said the UK , which has experienced serial blasts in 2005 , would continue to stand with India terrorism . . . Pakistan , which has become the breeding ground of terrorists , also condemned the blasts .

At the same time Australia said that the `` the attack on a democratic , tolerant , open society is repugnant '' and hoped that the perpetrators are brought quickly to justice . `` Australian and Indian law enforcement agencies continue to work together in our common fight against terrorism , '' a statement said . . . Another country that has been at the receiving end of terrorists , Israel , also joined the chorus of condemnation saying that it understood the `` enormity of the tragedy .
