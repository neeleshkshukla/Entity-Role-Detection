S"Anita Joshua ISLAMABAD : Ten persons including a television journalist were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a civil hospital in Balochistan 's capital Quetta on Friday morning . The blast took place when a large number of people had gathered around the hospital to protest the killing of a member of the minority Shia community . Besides the journalist , the dead includes two deputy superintendents of police , two policemen and a constable of the Federal Investigation Agency ( FIA ) . Barring the FIA constable , the journalist and police personnel were present at the civil hospital in view of the tense situation prevailing there after word broke of the targeted killing of Arshad Zaidi , son of a prominent Balochistan Shia Council leader . Mr. Zaidi who worked at a local bank was shot near his office and was shifted to the hospital where he succumbed to his wounds . The blast was triggered in the melee of protests and eye-witnesses said the loud explosion was followed by gunfire . At least 35 others were injured in the blast . OPEN"
