S"A deadly suicide bombing rocked the Syrian capital on Friday , capping a week of non-stop violence that has killed dozens and fuelled growing scepticism about hopes for the success of a UN-backed peace plan . Amid the unrest , demonstrations were taking place after weekly Muslim prayers in flashpoint cities such as Hama , where shelling by government troops has reportedly killed more than 100 people since Monday . The explosion shook Damascus ' central district of Midan , killing at least seven and wounding 20 , state television said , with civilians and security force members among the casualties . It blamed `` terrorists , '' the term used by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad to refer to rebels . A separate blast hit an industrial zone of Damascus , but there were no reports of casualties , and three security agents were wounded in a blast in the coastal city of Banias , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . Assad 's regime has repeatedly blamed `` armed terrorist groups '' for the violence , and for failing to abide by a putative ceasefire that went into force on April 12 . But UN chief Ban Ki-moon said the regime was in contravention of a six-point peace deal by keeping troops and heavy weapons in urban areas , and expressed alarm about reports population centres were shelled . On Thursday , 22 people died in Syria , most of them civilians , the Britain-based Observatory said . And overnight clashes between troops and rebels in the central city of Homs killed at least one army deserter and wounded another 15 , it added . More than 9,000 people have died since a popular uprising erupted against the president Assad 's regime in March 2011 , the UN says , while non-governmental groups put the figure at more than 11,100 .
