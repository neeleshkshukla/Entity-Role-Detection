It is learnt that a team conducted searches in Yamuna Vihar in this connection . However , no breakthrough was reported till late in the evening . While statements of the injured persons are being recorded to reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the incident , the police are trying to find its similarities with the May 25 low-intensity blast outside Gate No. 7 . Wednesday connection Both the blasts were carried out on a Wednesday , said to be the Public Interest Litigation day in the High Court . While there is more rush on Wednesdays , the timing was also chosen to ensure that maximum casualty was caused . The court proceedings were to commence and a large number of people had queued up to collect their entry passes . It was a well-planned terror attack . They must have conducted reconnaissance in the area before they struck , said a police officer . Police sources said there was some difference in the mixture of explosives used in both the blasts . Ammonium nitrate and some fuel oil were used in the previous case , said another police officer . In the wake of the blasts , anti-sabotage checks were carried out in all the Jammu-bound trains following an input . OPEN",
