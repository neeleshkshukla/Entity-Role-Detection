    "content": "Forensic scientists of the National Security Guard ( NSG ) believe that the lethal high explosive PETN ( pentaerythritol tetranitrate ) was used in Wednesday 's blast in the Delhi High Court complex , sources in the investigation told The Hindu . The use of PETN raises the prospect that the perpetrators had access to military-grade explosives either from terrorist groups operating in States like Jammu and Kashmir or from a military source . Except the 2010 bombing of the German Bakery in Pune , all post-26 / 11 urban terror attacks have used ammonium nitrate easily available for use in mining and as a fertilizer . Investigators , however , urged caution , saying the NSG 's finding needed to be corroborated by more thorough tests now being conducted at the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory . Two separate sources in the investigation said the pattern of the Delhi High Court strike did not appear to indicate the use of plastic explosives . Early findings of Indian bomb-tests have often been disproved by subsequent investigation . The 2006 attacks on Mumbai 's train system were thought to have used RDX , but later the chemical was found to be ammonium nitrate . PETN is used by both militaries and terrorist groups . In 2001 , al-Qaeda operative Richard Reid attempted to bring down a transatlantic flight using PETN hidden in his shoes . Eight years later , the Nigerian al-Qaeda operative , Umar Farooq Abdulmutallab , made a similar attempt , hiding 80 gm . of PETN inside his underwear . Al-Qaeda also used PETN for an attempt to bring down cargo planes last year using bombs hidden in inkjet printer cartridges . Difficult to detect The explosive is favoured by terrorists because sniffer dogs and machines find it difficult to detect it . Maharashtra investigators made an arrest in the Pune blast , and are seeking six fugitives , including the men they claim were responsible for fabricating and planting explosive devices . There has so far been no account of where the explosive material used in the bombing was obtained . Intelligence sources said RDX might have been sourced from terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir , but no hard evidence had emerged . OPEN",
