    "content": "More than 24 hours after a low-intensity explosive device went off near a car parked on a service lane outside the Delhi High Court , the Delhi Police had no clue to the identity of the group behind the blast or the motive . We are yet to conclusively identify the group behind the explosion . The matter is under investigation , Joint Commissioner of Police ( Special Cell ) R.S. Krishnia said on Thursday . Also , it is difficult to comment on the composition and nature of the bomb as we are awaiting the Central Forensic Science Laboratory 's report . The explosives kept in a case resembling a toilet-kit bag went off near Gate No. 7 . A battery-like object , wires and some nails were also found on the site by forensic experts . A white powder , suspected to be ammonium nitrate , was used . Though senior police officers remained tight-lipped about the investigation , sources said they were working on several theories . According to one theory , the bomb was meant to be planted in the court , but the culprit could not gain entry to the premises and abandoned the bag in the parking lot . Another is that the crude bomb was not meant to cause any major damage , and could be the handiwork of some disgruntled elements . Some eyewitnesses are reported to have told the police that they had seen a motorcyclist coming from the direction of the parked car minutes before the explosion . We have been trying to get the description of the motorcyclist the culprits could have come on foot or in a car . It seems the target has been chosen carefully as there are no closed-circuit television cameras there , a senior police officer said . OPEN",
