In Dispur , the blast occurred near a private hospital while the one in Fancy Bazaar occurred near a police outspost . . . The Inspector-General of Police -LRB- Special Branch -RRB- , Khagen Sharma , said that the police were trying to ascertain if the explosions were caused by programmable time delay devices . . .
