Despite prodding by journalists , Mr. Singh said , We will not share operational details and leads -LSB- with the media -RSB- at the moment . The specific roles of the suspects will be shared later . . . Mr. Singh denied that the suspects were tortured . When journalists pointed out that Upadhyay had mentioned in the court about the use of third degree methods , he categorically refuted the charge . . .

Public prosecutor Ajay Misar said it was necessary to keep the accused in 14-day police custody for investigation as a forensic report revealed the use of explosives like RDX in the September 29 Malegaon blast , which claimed six lives . . . Mr. Misar said Upadhyay and Sadhvi Pragya -LRB- a former office-bearer of the BJP student wing , Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad -RRB- had remained in communication . . .
