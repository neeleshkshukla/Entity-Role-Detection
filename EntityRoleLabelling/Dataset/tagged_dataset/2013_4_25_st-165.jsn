The police shifted the two to the Salem Central Prison and detained Saddam Hussain under Goondas Act . Hussain is the brother-in-law of Kichan Buhari , who the special team arrested in Madurai on Tuesday in connection with the blast . The sources said the two were suspected to have helped Buhari in procuring the vehicle from Sathyamangalam . OPEN",
