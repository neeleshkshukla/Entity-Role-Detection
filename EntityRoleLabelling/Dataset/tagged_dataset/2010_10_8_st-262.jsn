    "content": "A three-layer cordon will secure the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium for the second India-Australia cricket Test starting Saturday . Chastised after the blasts at the stadium in April on the day of an IPL match , the city police are taking no chances . The stadium has already been sanitised in the run-up to the five-day match . Anyone entering is being frisked , while anti-sabotage units are checking the length and breadth of the stadium . April blasts Two low-intensity crude bombs had gone off just before the IPL league match between Mumbai Indians and Bangalore Royal Challengers on April 17 this year , injuring 17 people and nine policemen . We have tightened the security to eliminate any chances of a recurrence , Deputy Commissioner of Police ( Central Division ) G. Ramesh told The Hindu . Even the stadium staff will not be spared from the checks , he added . The security is as per the blueprint devised by Assistant Commissioner of Police ( Cubbon Park Subdivision ) Devaraju and his colleagues . Eight Assistant Commissioners of Police , 30 police inspectors , 60 sub-inspectors and around 2,000 police constables are being deployed . At least 12 door-fitted metal detectors ( DFMD ) , about 100 hand-held metal detectors ( HHMD ) and 12 closed-circuit cameras have been installed in and outside the stadium . The cameras can see even in the dark , the police said . Spectators will not be allowed to carry bags , bottles , matchboxes , cigarette lighters , nail cutters or mobile phones into the stadium . Ad boards banned Considering the April bombs were hidden behind plastic boards , this time advertisement hoardings have been banned across the stadium . The police have told stadium officials to guard vulnerable areas , including ceilings , toilets and passages . The police have already checked the antecedents of stadium employees . They have also obtained the list of housekeeping staff and verified their background , Mr. Ramesh said . The police will keep ready a patrol vehicle , a fire tender and an ambulance near the stadium . OPEN",
