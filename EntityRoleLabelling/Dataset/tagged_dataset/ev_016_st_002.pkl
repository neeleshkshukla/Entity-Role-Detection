The Assam Chief Minister , Tarun Gogoi , has ordered an Additional Director-General of Police-level probe into the two blasts today during the Republic Day Parade . ` Appropriate action will be taken against whoever is found guilty for the security lapse , ' he told reporters . . . Mr. Gogoi said that people remained calm despite the blasts at the parade venue , which was a very a good sign and would foil attempts by the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- to create terror among the people by resorting to violence . . . ` Detection difficult ' . . The City Superintendent of Police , H.C. Nath , said that such explosives could not be detected with gadgets such as deep search metal detectors as militants used carbon and plastic materials . . . Call to militants . . In his ceremonial address , which began a few seconds after the second blast , the Governor , Lt. Gen. -LRB- retd . -RRB- Ajai Singh , said that the law and order situation had improved and that insurgents had in desperation resorted to sporadic attacks on soft targets .
