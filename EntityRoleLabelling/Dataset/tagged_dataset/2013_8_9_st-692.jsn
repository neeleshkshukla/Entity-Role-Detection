    "content": "A bomb planted in a graveyard in rural eastern Afghanistan killed 14 members of a single family on Thursday while a suicide bomber attacked a police officers funeral in southwestern Pakistan killing 30 people gathered to mourn a man shot dead earlier that day in front of his children . The Afghan family was getting together to mark the start of a major Muslim holiday , the Eid al-Fitr at the end of the holy month of Ramzan , with a visit to the tomb of a relative . The attack took place in Nangarhar provinces Ghany Khel district and all 14 killed seven women and seven children were members of the same extended family , said police . No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing . Its unclear why the family was targeted , but they were visiting the grave of a relative , a tribal elder named Haji Khayali who worked for a security company and who was killed by the Taliban earlier this year . The dead mans brother , Haji Ghalib , who said his daughter was among those killed Thursday , blamed the Taliban for the attack . Mr. Ghalib , who was not with his family when the bombing happened , said over the telephone that he also worked at a security company and was a member of a local peace council seeking to reconcile with the insurgents . A spate of bombings and Taliban attacks in Nangarhar in recent weeks has killed dozens of people , including police and security forces . Among the attacks was a botched bombing last week against the Indian consulate in the city of Jalalabad that killed nine people , including six children . No Indian officials were hurt . In Pakistan , the funeral was being held in an open field outside a mosque in Quetta , the capital of Balochistan province . Some 250 people gathered for the service . Fayaz Sumbal , the head of police operations in Baluchistan , noticed the bomber near the gate of the mosque before he detonated his explosives , a police official Mohammed said . Mr. Sumbal called on officers to question the bomber , who then blew himself up . Sumbal died in the blast . Most of the 30 dead and 55 wounded in the suicide bombing were police officers . They had gathered for the funeral of an officer gunned down earlier in the day as he travelled through the city in a vehicle with his children . Two of his children were wounded in the attack . No one has claimed responsibility for the attack , but suspicion will likely fall on Islamic militants based in the province . Baluchistan is also home to separatists who have been waging a low-level insurgency against the governments for decades , but they rarely carry out suicide bombings . AP OPEN",
