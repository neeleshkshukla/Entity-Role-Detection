Bangladesh 's elite anti-terror Rapid Action Battalion is currently verifying names and identities that have emerged from the Indian probe . Bangladesh Minister for Home Affairs Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said India had not yet officially provided the nationality of the two persons - suspected militants Shakil Ahmed and Sobhan Mandal - killed in the blast . `` We are always against terrorism . We will not allow anyone to use our land to conduct militant or terrorist activities against our country or neighbouring India , '' he said . Besides the two killed , one Hasan Saheb was injured in the blast ; three persons - Rajira Bibi alias Rumi , Amina Bibi and Hafez Mollah alias Hasan - have been arrested . According to Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin , Indian investigating agencies have been asked to collate and tabulate information on the Bardhaman blast to be shared with Bangladesh .
