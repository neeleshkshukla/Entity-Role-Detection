    "content": "A special National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) court on Tuesday granted bail to Lokesh Sharma , accused in the September 29 , 2008 , Malegaon blast case , in the absence of a charge sheet . The NIA failed to file a charge sheet within the stipulated 90-day period . So the court granted him bail on the condition of a PR -LSB- personal recognisance -RSB- bond of Rs . 25,000 , Sharma 's defence lawyer Aarti Bhide told The Hindu on the phone . The Malegaon blast threw the spotlight on Hindutva terror with the arrest of Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit and sadhvi Pragnya Singh Thakur in 2008 , among others . In February this year , the NIA arrested Indore resident Sharma , when he was already in judicial custody in connection with the Samjhauta train bombing case , for his alleged role in the Malegaon blast . He was produced before the special MCOCA court of Y.D. Shinde , which was later designated as the NIA court . Seeking his custody the NIA alleged that Sharma played a major role in the Malegaon blast case by providing logistical support . Joshi 's associate Sharma was alleged to be a close associate of Sunil Joshi ( the suspected ` mastermind ' behind the blasts who was later murdered ) . He was first arrested on June 17 , 2010 in connection with the Ajmer blast . His name reportedly cropped up in the Malegaon case during the interrogation of Samjhauta blast co-accused Kamal Chauhan . Six persons were killed and 89 injured when a crude bomb exploded in Bhikku chowk , in the town of Malegaon , Nashik district , in 2008 . OPEN",
