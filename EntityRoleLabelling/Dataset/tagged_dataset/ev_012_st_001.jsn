Luckily , there was no casualty . . . Senior NFR officials at the Maligaon headquarters here said the blast created a crater three feet deep and four feet wide . . . Police found a 138-metre long wire leading into a nearby tea garden from where the bomb seems to have been detonated . . . A metal container which is supposed to have contained the explosive charge was found near the blast site . . . Empty packets of dry food recovered from the tea garden suggest that the militants had bided their time through the night , police said .",
