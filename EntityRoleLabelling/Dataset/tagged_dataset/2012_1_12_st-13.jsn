Though the Bench , comprising Justices H.L. Dattu and C.K. Prasad , set aside the Delhi High Court judgment , the judges gave a split verdict in the case . Justice Dattu ordered a fresh trial , holding that the trial was vitiated as the appellant was not provided with a counsel to defend himself properly , while Justice Prasad held that the trial was illegal and directed him to be set at liberty and ordered his deportation . However , in view of the split verdict , the Bench requested that the matter be placed before the Chief Justice of India to seek another Bench to decide whether the case was to be given a fresh hearing or the accused should be set at liberty Mohammad Hussain alias Zulfikur Ali , the appellant , was awarded death after being found guilty of placing a bomb in a blue line bus at Rampura bus stand here on December 30 , 1997 , causing an explosion in which four persons were killed and 24 sustained injuries .
