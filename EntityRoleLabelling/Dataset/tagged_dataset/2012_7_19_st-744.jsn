    "content": ": Syrian defence minister General Daoud Rajha died in a suicide attack in Damascus on Wednesday , as raging battles across the capital upped the stakes ahead of a Security Council vote on the Syria crisis . State television said a suicide bomber targeted a meeting of ministers and security officials at the National Security headquarters in Rawda , a high security district in the heart of the capital , killing Rajha . Security officials told AFP that several other participants in the meeting were wounded in the blast and taken to Al-Shami hospital in the capital for treatment . The officials said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar was among the wounded . Rajha , a Christian , was defence minister , deputy army chief and deputy of the Council of Ministers . Syria 's army chief is President Bashar al-Assad . The National Security branch -- a key part of the country 's security apparatus -- is headed by General Hisham Ikhtiyar . There was no immediate news of Ikhtiyar 's fate after the bombing . The attack came as battles raged across Damascus and after the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) -- comprising defected soldiers and civilians who have taken up arms against Assad 's forces -- warned the Assad regime to `` expect surprises .
