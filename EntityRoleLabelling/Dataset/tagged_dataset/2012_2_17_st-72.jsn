These include the bomb blasts in Malegaon , Modassa ( Gujarat ) , the Ajmer Sharif Dargah and the Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad . In a statement here on Thursday , the Home Ministry said the 2006 Malegaon blast , the 2007 bombing of the Samjhauta Express , the Mecca Masjid and the Ajmer dargah and the 2008 explosions in Malegaon and Modassa were being either reinvestigated or further probed . The Ministry said the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) had arrested Naba Kumar Sarkar alias Swami Aseemanand , Lokesh Sharma , Devender Gupta and a few others in connection with these cases . Kamal Chauhan , who was arrested by the NIA on Sunday , claimed that he had planted bombs on board the Samjhauta Express that left 68 people , mostly Pakistanis , dead . The Ministry 's response came after the spokesperson of a political party said no case of terror had been solved by investigating agencies in the last eight years . Seven cases solved Giving details of major terrorist incidents since May 2000 , the Ministry said there were 46 incidents and of these all but seven cases were solved . In nine cases , convictions have been obtained . In the remaining 30 cases , charge sheets have been filed in 29 cases and trial has commenced in 19 cases . Two cases ended in acquittal and appeals have been preferred . Of the seven unsolved cases , four cases are close to being solved . OPEN",
