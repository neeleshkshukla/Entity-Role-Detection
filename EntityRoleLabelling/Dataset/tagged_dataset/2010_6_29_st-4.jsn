    "content": "The possibility of identifying the origin of explosives used in Mecca Masjid blast is bleak as the Andhra Pradesh Forensic Laboratory ( APFSL ) had destroyed the seized explosives . Chemical analysis Police had recovered an unexploded improvised explosive device ( IED ) from the mosque after another IED went off killing nine persons on May 18 , 2007 . The unexploded IED was then sent to the APFSL for chemical analysis . But after it completed its job , the laboratory authorities ordered destruction of the explosive charges . The destruction of the explosives came to light after the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) had written to the APFSL a month ago asking to send samples of the explosives so that it could try and find out where the explosives were made and the corresponding batch numbers . The CBI , which took over the blast investigation , wanted to send the samples to the Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) for chemical fingerprinting . The DRDO has the necessary technological knowhow to pin-pointedly determine where the explosives were manufactured and that could have been clinching scientific evidence against the accused persons . But the CBI was in for a surprise when the APFSL informed on June 9 that it had destroyed all the samples in the interest of lab safety and security . Dangerous APFSL Director O. Narasimham Murthy said explosive substances sent to the lab would be destroyed as storing explosives posed a danger to the lab . The front portion of the three-storeyed lab was destroyed in an accidental blast of stored explosives , in 1994 . We get explosives for analysis from different States . We can not possibly store all the explosives in the lab . It 's dangerous , Mr. Murthy explained . CBI sources said the investigation was now based on circumstantial evidences . Had FSL provided us the samples , it could have helped us get scientific evidence against the accused , they explained . Ajmer samples The agency is now being helped by the NSG 's National Bomb Data Centre in determining the place of manufacture of explosives . We are also trying to get samples seized in Ajmer where the same accused persons triggered a similar explosion at a religious place , sources said . Cyclotol According to sources , the IEDs used in Masjidblast had 200 to 300 grams of Cyclotol - a mixture of RDX ( 90 per cent ) and Trinitrotoluene or TNT ( 10 per cent ) . APFSL informs CBI on June 9 that it had destroyed all the samples We can not possibly store all the explosives in the lab : APFSL Director OPEN",
