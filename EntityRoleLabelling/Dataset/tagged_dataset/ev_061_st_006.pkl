VFront Page Serial blasts kill 70 persons in Delhi . . Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : At least 70 persons were killed and several injured in three powerful serial explosions here on Saturday evening . While two bombs went off at busy marketplaces , one exploded inside a Delhi Transport Corporation bus . Following the explosions , suspected to have been caused by Improvised Explosive Devices , a countrywide red alert was sounded . No terrorist outfit has so far claimed responsibility . . . The first explosion took place around 5.25 p.m. at Chheh Tuti Chowk in Paharganj , central Delhi , the bus blast at 5.40 p.m. at Govindpuri in South Delhi and the third and most powerful one at 5.45 p.m. at the Sarojini Nagar market in South-West Delhi . An explosive device was defused outside the State Bank of Bikaner at Chandni Chowk in the Walled City area . . . Shops go up in flames . . At Sarojini Nagar , it is suspected that the bomb was planted inside a Maruti van parked near shops . Within seconds , half a dozen cloth shops went up in flames . Subsequently , a couple of gas cylinders exploded inside a juice and chaat shop . The festival buzz at the bustling market place gave way to chaos as people fled fearing more explosions . Such was the impact of the blast that some shops just crumbled . The police did not rule out the possibility of people lying buried under the debris . At least 40 persons died in the blast here . Scores were injured , some of them critically . . . The bomb that rocked the Paharganj main bazaar is suspected to have been planted in a motorcycle or a rickshaw parked near a jewellery shop . People scattered in panic as smoke swirled from the blast site . . . Eyewitnesses said the jewellery outlet and adjoining shops took the impact . There were pools of blood on the road with body parts strewn around . Bags , shoes and chappals lay scattered . Local traders with the help of the police rushed the injured to the Ram Manohar Lohia , Lady Hardinge and Kalawati Saran hospitals . . . According to police sources , at least 25 persons were killed and over 45 injured in this blast . Four bodies , including that of a child , were burnt beyond recognition . . . The explosion in the DTC bus -LRB- DL-1PB-2719 -RRB- near the Kalkaji Depot injured six persons , including the driver and the conductor . Eyewitnesses said the passengers sounded an alert after they spotted an unclaimed bag under a seat . After stopping the bus at the roundabout near Anandmai Marg , the driver picked up the bag , triggering the explosion , it is said . All the injured were rushed to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences . . . Soon after the blasts , the Union Home Ministry convened an emergency meeting to review security in the capital . Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit announced an ex gratia payment of Rs . 3 lakhs to the families of each of the deceased and Rs . 50,000 to those seriously injured . . . RDX suspected . . Police Commissioner K.K. Paul , visiting the site of blasts , said investigations were handed over to the Special Cell of the Delhi police . RDX is suspected to have been used in the bombs . . . Even as raids were under way at hotels and guesthouses , unconfirmed reports said two persons from Kashmir were detained at the New Delhi railway station . An agency report said 10 persons were taken into custody .
