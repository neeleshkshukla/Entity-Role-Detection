But how the conspiracy was hatched , how the plan was executed is still to be ascertained , an NIA official told The Hindu . . . The investigators recovered , during a raid at Iram lodge in Ranchi , a sheet of paper which they say were prepared by Hyder Ali , a suspect named in the Patna blasts FIR , currently absconding . . . All five of Hyder , Imtiaz Ansari , Tariq alias Ainul , Taufeeq and Mujibal Ansari are planters in the Bodh Gaya case , NIA sources told The Hindu . Except Mujibal , all others are named in the Patna blast FIR . Ainul , who was injured while planting a bomb in the toilet of the Patna railway station , succumbed to his injuries . . . Hyder was the planter of the bomb near the Bodhi tree . The sheet not only plots the blast locations , such as wall and tree , but also lists the number of bombs at each location and the name of the planter besides it . The document was prepared by someone who only addressed himself as me . It could possibly be Hyder , NIA sources said.This Ranchi module of the Indian Mujahideen , mentored by IM operative Tehseen Akhtar , is the group identified for the Bodh Gaya blast . . . Interrogation of IM commander Yasin Bhatkal revealed that the group had been aiming to target Bodh Gaya for over a year . While the specific motive of the attack is still under investigation , the possible aim was to avenge the Rohingya issue in Myanmar , where Rohingya Muslims have faced persecution . . . In addition , on the cylinder bombs that were defused at the temple site , investigators had found chits stuck on the cylinder carrying some text . We have found the original material that links to the text of these papers . It is jihadi literature , an NIA official said .",
