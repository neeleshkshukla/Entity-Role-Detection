S'The police , with the support of a bomb squad and Fire and Rescue Services personnel , conducted searches in and around Narikkatteri , near Nadapuram , in Kozhikode district on Sunday and seized 5 kg of gunpowder and raw materials for making steel bombs following a bomb explosion that killed five persons and injured six on Saturday night . The explosives packed in plastic covers were found hidden in a well near the blast site . Police sources said those killed and injured in the incident were Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML ) workers . The explosion occurred while the youths were allegedly trying to transfer steel bombs to secret locations . Those killed are C. Riyas , 28 ; C.T. Sameer , 24 ; P. Rafeek , 26 ; V.P.Shabeer , 25 ; and K. Shabeer , 27 . The bodies were handed over to their relatives after post-mortem examination at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital on Sunday evening . Those who suffered burns are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kozhikode . The explosion was reported around 10.30 p.m. on Saturday at an isolated hilly area of the politically sensitive Narikkattery . IUML denies role Meanwhile , the IUML leadership denied the involvement of party men in the incident . District secretary M.C. Mayin Haji said those killed and injured in the incident were not members of the party and had hardly any relation with party members . He affirmed that the party would initiate strong action if the police found any solid evidence proving the involvement of League workers . A team of senior police officers headed by Inspector-General of Police ( Kannur ) G. Sudhesh Kumar inspected the spot and held discussions with Superintendent of Police ( Rural ) Neeraj Kumar for tightening surveillance in the region . Mr. Sudhesh Kumar said an inquiry would be conducted into the incident . A case has been registered . Earlier on Saturday , 13 houses were partially damaged at Payanthongu in Nadapuram after country-made bombs were hurled by anonymous persons following political clashes . OPEN'
