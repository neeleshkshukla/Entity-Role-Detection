In the first incident at reported at Ghari in Imphal West at 10 a.m. , personnel of 18 Sikh Regiment , deployed at the Tulihal airport , were collecting drinking water , when a bomb was exploded with a remote control . Two of the personnel , a woman , a student and a driver were wounded . Hospital sources said they were out of danger . Two more bombs exploded nearby in quick succession and two others went off in Thoubal district , targeting security personnel . But there was no casualty . No claim from underground outfits Though there has been no claim from any underground outfit , militants of seven militant organisations , which have formed the CorCom , have been attacking security personnel since September 5 . Migrant workers start leaving Manipur Meanwhile , following a fiat from the CorCom , migrant workers have started leaving Manipur , hoping to come back once normality is restored . On Wednesday , over 150 of them vacated their rented houses in and around Imphal city . Home Minister G. Gaikhangam is in touch with Director General of Police Yumnam Joykumar , asking him to open relief camps for the insecure workers . The CorCom has set a December 31 deadline for the migrant workers to leave the State . In the past , they could not get meaningful protection . Moreover , being daily wage earners they could not remain in relief camps in the city indefinitely . OPEN'
