Kothakota village of Uravakonda mandal in the district as the body of a young victim Anand Kumar ( 24 ) - was brought home on Thursday after the Hyderabad blasts . Anand Kumar , an engineering graduate from Nova College of Engineering hailed from Anantapur district , who by a stroke of bad luck , was killed on Thursday evening in the bomb blast when he stood at a bus stop in Dilsukhnagar waiting to go back after attending software coaching classes at an institute nearby . Anand was a bright student . He had such a bright future ahead . I wish I had not sent him to Hyderabad at all , Veeranna , Anands father said . Speaking to The Hindu , he said that Anand had only recently joined a software coaching centre at Hyderabad and was preparing for competitive exams too . Veeranna who works as a junior assistant with the Irrigation Department in Kurnool district was inconsolable as the last rites were being performed at his native village of V. Kothakota in Uravakonda mandal . The entire village was in attendance to express solidarity with the family as the last rites were being performed . Meanwhile , local political leaders who gathered to pay their respects demanded that the government , besides conducting a thorough and fast investigation into the blasts to bring the culprits to justice , should announce an ex-gratia of Rs .15 lakh for the kin of the deceased .
