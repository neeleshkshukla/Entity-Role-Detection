One top source said the blasts in Kashmir and those in Mumbai certainly seem corelated , though all possible angles were being probed . . . Terrorism expert B Raman said the Kashmir blasts and the Mumbai blasts seem orchestrated by the same command and control . . . Raman believes there is a strong possibility of Al Qaeda being behind the blasts and they could have been executed by fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim -- who was behind the March 12 , 1993 blasts in Mumbai -- or the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e - Tayiba . . . A Mumbai special court is likely to deliver judgment on the 1993 blasts soon . .",
