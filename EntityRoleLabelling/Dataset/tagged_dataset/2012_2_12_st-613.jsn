Haroon pleaded innocent before the court after he asked the court the reason for his arrest . The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) has so far made four arrests in the case . All four have been charged under various sections of the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , the Explosives Act , the Indian Penal Code , etc. . The court also granted police custody to the other two accused in another bomb blast case the same day . Thus all four accused are to stay in police custody Haroon and Pathrija till February 18 and the other two till February 17 . Three bombs went off at Zaveri Bazar , Opera House and Dadar Kabutarkhana on July 13 last year . The ATS earlier arrested Naquee Ahmed Wasi Ahmed Sheikh and Nadeem Ahmed Ashfaq Sheikh in the Opera House blast case . Their police custody ended on Friday , after which they were granted judicial custody till February 24 . But the ATS showed them as arrested in the Zaveri Bazar blast case and sought their custody . They have booked them for the Zaveri Bazar blast now , the lawyer for both the accused said . Naquee and Nadeem , both hailing from Darbhanga in Bihar , were arrested in Mumbai by the ATS on the charge of involvement in the blasts . They were previously arrested for procuring SIM cards with fake documents . Haroon was in prison since last year after the ATS arrested him in a fake Indian currency case in August 2011 . Last month , the ATS filed a transfer request for Haroon 's custody in the case , which was granted on February 1 . The ATS has accused him of sending Rs .10 lakh used for the blast from Saudi Arabia to hawala operator Pathrija in New Delhi . OPEN",
