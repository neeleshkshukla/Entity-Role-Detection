    "content": "Following their call for a 24-hour nationwide lockdown , Maoist rebels struck again in Bihar 's Gaya district on Monday when two security personnel from a bomb disposal squad were killed while defusing a powerful can bomb planted by the Naxals on the premises of the district 's Bankebazaar block . Earlier in the day , 10 coaches of a goods train derailed in Muzaffarpur district after Naxals dynamited a railway track near the Kurhani railway station on the Hajipur-Muzaffarpur section of East Central Railway . The incidents come on the eve of polling for 35 constituencies spread across eight districts in the fifth phase of the Legislative Assembly polls . The deceased personnel , identified as Vijay Kumar and Jai Chand Prasad , were members of a Bihar Military Police ( BMP ) battalion . Terming the incident as highly unfortunate , Bihar DGP Neelmani said the bomb went off accidentally while it was being defused.Two State Auxiliary Police ( SAP ) personnel and two members of a local television news channel were also injured in the incident . Critical Mr. Neelmani said the injured SAP personnel were in a critical condition and undergoing treatment at the Gaya Medical College . The journalists sustained injuries while recording the bomb disposal process . They were brought to Patna in an Indian Air Force helicopter , where they are currently undergoing treatment at the Patna Medical College Hospital . Following the blast , senior police officials rushed to Gaya to monitor the operation against the extremists . Sources said the shutdown call by the Naxals ostensibly comes to register protest against U.S. President Barack Obama 's visit , while also calling for boycotting the Bihar polls . The derailment of the goods train caused a disruption in rail services since 3 a.m. Trains were diverted from Hajipur to Muzaffarpur via the Sahpur-Patori station . OPEN",
