A press note distributed to newspaper offices in Imphal on Wednesday evening said the KCP -LRB- MC -RRB- triggered the explosion in order to put an end to lagao , a form of gambling which it said was an `` alien culture '' and was adversely affecting Manipuri society . . . `` Lagao is a form of gambling which is alien to Meitei culture and it needs to be stopped , '' said the statement signed by Lanheiba Meitei , leader of the KCP -LRB- MC -RRB- , one of the several factions of the original KCP that was formed in 1980 . Named after the historical name of Manipur , Kangleipak , the KCP is more concerned with preservation of Meitei culture and demands secession of Manipur from India . . . The blast had occurred at around 7:30 PM at Ragailong , a locality on the outskirts of Imphal and killed 17 persons , most of whom were engaged in lagao , a game of dice that becomes increasingly popular in the Manipur capital around diwali . Sources said at least 20 persons are undergoing treatment in the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences while some are in the JN Hospital too .",
