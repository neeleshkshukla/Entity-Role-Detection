    "content": "Although terror outfit Indian Mujahideen has purportedly claimed responsibility for the Delhi High Court blast through three emails in the past two days , police officers have kept the scope of the probe open on suspicion of the involvement of a new and well organised outfit . While both the High Court blasts are widely being perceived as the handiwork of the same group , senior police officers believe that they were carried out by different outfits . The first one was of low intensity and so was the Mehrauli blast , indicating that they were not executed by organised terror groups . Since many IM operatives have been arrested in the past few years and 11 of them are said to have fled to various countries , including Saudi Arabia , the officers have doubts about its role in the blast . They suspect that the outfit 's capability to strike has reduced considerably . According to another theory , the group that had carried out the May 25 blast at the High Court would have acquired expertise during the past three months to execute the powerful blast on Wednesday . However , it is not yet clear if it had the know-how to configure a sophisticated improvised explosive device . The bomb that exploded on September 7 was indeed powerful and had the potential to cause more damage . It was definitely masterminded by an organised group of terrorists , said a police officer , adding that IM still remains one of the prime suspects . Even as a hunt has been launched for the email senders , the police have requested the mall owners in the city to install outdoor closed-circuit television cameras . Henceforth , traffic policemen will be involved in random checking of vehicles across the city , said the police officer . It is also learnt that the police have identified the man behind the Mehrauli blast , who is suspected to be hiding somewhere in Bangladesh . Henceforth , traffic policemen will be involved in random checking of vehicles ' OPEN",
