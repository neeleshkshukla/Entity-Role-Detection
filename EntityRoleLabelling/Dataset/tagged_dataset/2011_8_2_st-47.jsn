    "content": "Five persons , including a 10-year-old girl student , were killed and 12 injured in a blast at the Sangakpham market , near here , on Monday . The death toll may go up as many injured persons are in serious condition . Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi , who returned from New Delhi , rushed to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences , where most of the injured are being treated . Minister Y. Erabot , under whose constituency the blast took place , and Director-General of Police Y. Joykumar also visited the injured at the hospital . Mr. Joykumar told The Hindu that an IED ( improvised explosive device ) was planted in a two-wheeler that was parked in front of a barber shop in the market . The blast , whose vibrations could be felt about 10 km away , took place at 1.50 p.m. . While the body of the girl was identified , those of the other deceased were badly mutilated . No militant organisation has claimed responsibility for the blast so far . Some weeks ago , a car bomb exploded at the Khuman Lampak sports complex , a little distance away from Monday 's blast site . Three persons , including a girl , were wounded in the blast . A special police team is looking into the possibility of involvement of militant organisations that had served a quit notice to migrant workers . The barber shop was run by migrant workers from Bihar . Police and security forces are combing all suspected areas . No arrest has been made so far . Schoolgirl among victims No militant group has claimed responsibility so far OPEN",
