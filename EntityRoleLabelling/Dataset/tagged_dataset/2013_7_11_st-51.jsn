    "content": "The investigation into Sundays serial bomb blasts at Bodh Gaya seem to be heading nowhere , with the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) , which was formally handed over the probe late on Tuesday night , still searching for some definite clues . As happened in the Hyderabad blasts case -LSB- that took place in February this year -RSB- , even after four days , the NIA , along with the Bihar police , has failed to zero in on a terror group or those elements who are behind the blasts , a senior Home Ministry official said . Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told journalists here on Wednesday the NIA would look into all angles into the blasts . There are so many complex problems . Infiltration from other countries is there , Naxalites are there , local communal disturbances are thereWe have to see all angles . The NIA will look into everything NIA has been given the task of conducting the investigation and they will do it in detail . Till the probe is completed , I can not say anything , Mr. Shinde said . In Hyderabad -LSB- case -RSB- the probe was taken over by NIA a bit late , but here -LSB- the Mohabodhi temple blasts case -RSB- , the government had acted swiftly -LSB- and handed over the probe to NIA -RSB- , he noted . However , sources in the Ministry said the NIA was handed over the case to ensure that the State police and other agencies do not botch it up as happened in the Hyderabad blasts case . Giving the NIA full mandate from the beginning would help in speedy investigation , the sources said . Mr. Shinde said the NIA was looking into the purported claim made by the Indian Mujahideen on a Twitter account to have carried out the Bodh Gaya blasts and threats to target Mumbai . The Home Ministry has asked the CERT-In to probe the matter . OPEN",
