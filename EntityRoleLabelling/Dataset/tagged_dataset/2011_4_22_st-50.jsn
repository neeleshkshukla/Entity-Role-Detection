A Bench of Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Misra issued the notice and scheduled further hearing of the matter for April 29 , after hearing senior counsel Shanti Bhushan and counsel Adolf Mathews appearing for Mr. Maudany . Mr. Bhushan said Mr. Maudany was an accused in the Coimbatore bomb blast case , and was acquitted ; thereafter , he was implicated in the Bangalore blast case . In his special leave petition against a fast track court order rejecting his bail petition , Mr. Maudany said his movements were restricted because of the amputation of his right leg below the knee ; he was dependent on a wheelchair . He was also suffering from chronic diabetes , coronary heart disease , cervical spondylosis , and other ailments . He said his name was not at all mentioned in the charge sheet filed initially ; it figured only in the additional charge sheet filed on June 11 , 2010 before the First Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate , Bangalore . The magistrate issued a non-bailable warrant against him . OPEN",
