    "content": "Ajmer 's Chief Judicial Magistrate on Tuesday extended the police remand of two accused in the 2007 Ajmer dargah blast case till November 23 . The Rajasthan Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) had arrested the two accused from Vadodara and Godhra in Gujarat earlier this month . For interrogation CJM Ratan Lal Moond , before whom Harshad Solanki and Mukesh Vasni were produced at the expiry of their police remand , extended the remand period on the public prosecutor 's request for facilitating interrogation of the duo and gathering of evidence . The ATS has claimed that Harshad had prepared the bombs and Mukesh planted them at Ahata-e-Noor and elsewhere in the Sufi shrine on October 11 , 2007 . One of the bombs exploded and killed three persons breaking the Ramzan fast . Three other accused against whom the charge-sheet has been filed are said to be involved in the conspiracy of gathering the bomb-making material , assembling them , packaging bombs to Ajmer and triggering the blast . The 806-page ATS charge-sheet says that they worked under the guidance of senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar . While Mukesh is an anti-cow slaughter activist based in Godhra , Harshad is also the main accused in the 2002 Best Bakery carnage in Vadodara . He was absconding since 2004 and allegedly conspired with the main accused and the mastermind , Sunil Joshi who was later murdered in Madhya Pradesh during the period of hiding to carry out the dargah blast .
