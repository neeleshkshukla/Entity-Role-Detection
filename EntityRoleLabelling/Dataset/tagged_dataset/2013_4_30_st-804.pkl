S"Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi escaped an assassination bid on Monday , surviving a blast that targeted his convoy in Damascus , Syrian state television reported . One of his bodyguards was killed in the attack which left a second bodyguard and his driver seriously injured , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights watchdog said . `` The terrorist explosion in Mazzeh was an attempt to target the prime minister 's convoy and Dr. Wael al-Halqi was unharmed , '' state television reported . The Observatory reported that a car bomb targeted Halqi 's convoy as it passed through the Mazzeh district of Damascus . Director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bomb appeared to have been detonated from a distance . State television said the explosion happened near a public garden and a school in the neighbourhood , a well-secured district that is home to embassies , government buildings , intelligence facilities and several political figures . `` I was walking in the street when suddenly there was a very powerful explosion and I saw a car burning and people running , '' a young man told AFP at the scene . `` I heard glass shattering , '' he added , saying he had tried to hide for fear a second explosion would follow .
