Zubair , a resident of Multan in Pakistan , is the second person to be arrested in the attack on the CRPF camp near the Police-Public school in Bemina on Wednesday after Bashir alias Haroon Bhai was held hours after the attack . . . Sources said that Bashir , who hailed from Uri along the Line of Control -LRB- LoC -RRB- in Baramulla district , had tipped the state police about Zubair 's movements which led to his arrest . . . The sources said Zubair told the interrogators that he had dropped the two ` fidayeens ' -LRB- suicide attackers -RRB- hailing from his country along with Bashir , a surrendered militant . . . According to the police , Zubair had crossed over from Uri in north Kashmir a month ago and was followed by the two ` fidayeens ' who hailed from Sahiwal and Dera Gazi Khan in Pakistan . . .
