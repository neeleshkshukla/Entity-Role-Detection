The sources said Zubair told the interrogators that he had dropped the two ` fidayeens ' -LRB- suicide attackers -RRB- hailing from his country along with Bashir , a surrendered militant . . . According to the police , Zubair had crossed over from Uri in north Kashmir a month ago and was followed by the two ` fidayeens ' who hailed from Sahiwal and Dera Gazi Khan in Pakistan . . .
