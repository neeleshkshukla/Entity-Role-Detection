VNew Delhi : Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( MIM ) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has strongly condemned BJP leader Sushma Swaraj for linking him and his brother MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi to the Disukhnagar serial blasts case . in her speech in Parliament on Friday , Leader of Opposition Swaraj had linked Owaisi brothers with the twin blasts which claimed 16 lives . . . During her speech in Parliament , Swaraj had wondered if the twin blasts had to do with provocative speeches by Asaduddin Owaisi or his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi . `` Do these blasts have a connection with the provocative speeches made by an honourable member of this house ? '' she asked , initiating an impromptu discussion . . . Reacting to Swarajs remarks , the Hyderabad MP said the remarks were `` unfortunate '' and `` irresponsible '' . . . `` Swaraj can hate me , but she should have waited for the investigations to conclude before politically exploiting the issue . Most of those killed were from my constituency . Five of them were Muslims . Terror does not discriminate between religion , '' Hindustan Times has quoted Owaisi as saying . . . Slamming Swaraj , Owaisi said , `` One does n't accept such irresponsible statements from the Leader of the Opposition and one of the contenders for the PM 's post at a time when the last rites of the martyrs have not yet been performed . '' . . He described the bombings as an `` attack on the nation '' . He further said despite differences with the Congress government , his party was `` extending all cooperation '' to maintain calm and peace . . . googletag.display ( ` div-gpt-ad-1415181470682-6 ' ) ; . . googletag.display ( ` div-gpt-ad-1415181470682-6 ' ) ; . . .
