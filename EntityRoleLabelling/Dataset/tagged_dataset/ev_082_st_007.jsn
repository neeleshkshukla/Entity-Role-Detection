    "content": "Terrorists struck Agartala for the first time as two persons were killed and 100 injured in a series of five blasts at crowded markets and bus stands in a space of five minutes on Wednesday evening.The low-intensity blasts took place at Agartala 's main shopping area Maharaja Ganju Bazar , Gobind Ballabh Pant market , busy Radhanagar bus stand , Agartala Motorstand and Abhay Nagar localities.The first blast occurred at Radhanagar bus stand at around 7.30 pm and it was followed by the explosions in the other places in quick succession , police sources said.An unidentified man was killed in the blast at G.B. Market while another person succumbed to injuries.The condition of five of the injured was stated to be critical.A live bomb was recovered at Agartala Motorstand while another exploded without causing any casualty as the place had by that time emptied of people.Bomb squads and forensic experts examined the blast sites.Police sources , quoting eyewitnesses , said two persons riding a motorcycle were seen moving suspiciously at Radhanagar bus stand and the blast took place there two to three minutes after they left the area.Police sources suspect the involvement of Bangladesh-based terror group Hizbul Mujaheedin Islamia ( HuJI ) which has of late used Tripura as a transit route as the state shares a porous 856-km border with the neighbouring country.Three suspected HuJI members were arrested in Agartala in the last two months.Central intelligence agencies had on September 25 warned the northeastern states of an impending terror attack and BSF officials in Agartala confirmed having received the input.It was for the first time that serial blasts rocked Agartala but people did not appear to have panicked with many people preferring to remain outdoors even in the blast-hit areas and many organisers of Durga Puja , which begins on October 5 , going ahead with preparations for the big occasion . .",
