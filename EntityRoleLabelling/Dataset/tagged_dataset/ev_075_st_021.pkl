VJAIPUR : Highly-explosive RDX was used in the serial blasts that rocked Jaipur on Tuesday , a senior police official said on Wednesday as tell-tale signs pointed towards the involvement of Bangladesh - based Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami in the serial blasts . -LRB- Watch -RRB- The explosive devices were fitted with timers and planted on cycles , a modus operandi similar to the one used in last year 's blasts on court premises in Uttar Pradesh in which HuJI was involved , police said . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Eight persons including a man injured in the blasts and a rickshaw puller are being questioned , they said , noting that seven teams of Rajasthan police and intelligence branch have begun the probe into the blasts . -LRB- Watch -RRB- ` It was a cent per cent terrorist attack on the pattern of blasts on the court premises in UP in November last year . RDX was used in containers tagged to cycles along with timer devices , ' Additional Director General of Police -LRB- Crime -RRB- A K Jain said . An examination of the blast sites indicated that the bombs were filled with ball bearings and small iron pieces to act as splinters , sources close to the investigation said . HuJI may have been able to form sleeper cells in Rajasthan , they said , adding that a proper investigation into the blast at a sufi shrine in Ajmer last year could have been a pointer . ` We have collected sufficient evidence from the places of the blasts . They are being analysed by our technical experts , ' Superintendent of Police , Jaipur , Raghvendra Suhasa said , noting that one unexploded bomb , found from the blast site , has been defused . Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta told mediapersons in New Delhi that ` our priority now apart from vigilance and being on the alert will be to get hold of the people responsible ' for the blasts . Sources said the blasts triggered in areas close to two Hanuman temples in the old city could have been aimed at disturbing communal peace .
