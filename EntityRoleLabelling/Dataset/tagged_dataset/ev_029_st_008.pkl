VA bomb hidden in a rickshaw exploded in a crowded market place in India 's northeastern state of Assam on today , killing seven people and wounding 18 . . . Authorities said the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom ( ULFA ) was behind the attack in the busy market area of Athgaon in central Guwahati , the state 's main city . . . `` It is absolutely clear the ULFA is behind this attack , '' a police officer said . Three dead bodies lay on the blood splattered road which was littered with parts of human flesh . The body of the rickshaw driver remained mangled in his vehicle where the bomb had been hidden . . . Nearby vehicles were also damaged by the impact of the blast which took place a day ahead of celebrations to mark the state government 's first year in office after elections . . . Fire engines rushed to the site , while local traders quickly placed the dead and injured on wooden hand carts and in rickshaws , evacuating them to a nearby hospital . . . `` Someone was carrying a gas cylinder at the time of the explosion which caught fire and that caused maximum damage , '' a senior police officer said . . . Hospital sources said three of the 18 injured were in a critical condition , warning that the death toll could increase . . . The ULFA says it is fighting for the independence of Assam , which is rich in oil , natural gas and tea . The group accuses New Delhi of taking away its mineral and forest resources while neglecting the local population . . . More than 20,000 people have been killed since the insurgency began in 1979 .
