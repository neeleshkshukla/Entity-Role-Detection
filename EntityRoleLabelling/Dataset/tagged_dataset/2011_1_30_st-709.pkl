S"Russian investigators have traced the deadly Moscow airport bombing earlier this week to the country 's restive southern region that includes Chechnya . The Investigative Committee has identified the suicide bomber as a 20-year-old man from Northern Caucasus , said the committee 's spokesman on Saturday . The bomb killed 35 people and wounded 180 at Domodedovo airport on Monday . The act of terrorism at Domodedovo has been solved , said spokesman Vladimir Markin . Even though the investigators know the man 's name we wo n't disclose it today because the search is on for the attack masterminds and their accomplices , the Interfax news wire quoted Mr. Markin as saying . He added the attackers had targeted foreigners and therefore bombed the international arrival hall at Domodedovo . Investigators have also detained four people and are looking for several more persons for their involvement in an accidental explosion that killed a suspected black widow suicide bomber at a rented cabin in a Moscow sports club on December 31 . A terrorist group planned to carry out a terrorist attack in the centre of Moscow on New Year eve , said the spokesman . He denied the incident was linked to the airport bombing , saying the two blasts were the work of unconnected armed gangs operating in different regions of Northern Caucasus . A newspaper report suggested that the December 31 bomb was to be set off by a text message sent to the black widow 's mobile phone when she would mix with crowds celebrating the New Year in Red Square . However , the bomb was caused to go off earlier by a greetings message from the phone company . OPEN"
