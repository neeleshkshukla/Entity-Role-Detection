S"Special Correspondent NEW DELHI : India on Monday strongly condemned the twin suicide bomb blasts in Moscow earlier in the day , with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh writing to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to assure him of India 's solidarity with the country in combating the forces of violence and terrorism . It is with great anguish that I have learnt of the bomb blasts in Moscow , which have led to the loss of so many innocent lives . This is a most tragic and horrific act of violence . At this difficult hour our thoughts are with you , the people of Russia and the families and friends of the victims of this terrible tragedy . On behalf of the Government and people of India , I convey our deepest condolences , Dr. Singh said in the letter to Mr. Medvedev . The Ministry of External Affairs has termed the killing of civilians as targeted violence and hoped the perpetrators of these senseless attacks will be brought to justice .
