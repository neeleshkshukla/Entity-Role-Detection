    "content": "A wave of car bombs in southern Iraq killed 20 people on Sunday as the country grapples with a spike in violence and prolonged political deadlock , sparking fears of all-out sectarian war . In all , seven vehicles rigged with explosives went off in five cities south of Baghdad during morning rush hour , leaving 56 people wounded in primarily Shiite Muslim areas of Iraq . No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks , but Sunni militant groups linked to Al-Qaeda frequently target Shiites , whom they regard as apostates , in coordinated attacks . Car bombs went off in Kut , Aziziyah , Mahmudiyah , Nasiriyah and Basra , officials said.In Kut , provincial capital of Wasit and 160 kilometres south of Baghdad , a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in an industrial area packed with vehicle repair garages , killing seven people and wounding 15 . Another car bomb in nearby Aziziyah in the town 's main marketplace and near a Shiite mosque killed five and wounded 10 . Twin blasts in the southern port city of Basra , meanwhile , killed five people , including a bomb disposal expert looking to defuse one of the rigged vehicles . Three others were killed in bombings in Nasiriyah and Mahmudiyah.The violence was the latest in a spike in attacks nationwide , with last month registering the highest death toll since 2008 , sparking fears of a return to the all-out sectarian war that blighted Iraq in 2006 and 2007 .
