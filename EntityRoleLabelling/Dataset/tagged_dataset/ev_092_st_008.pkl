VChief Minister Raman Singh reached Rajnandgaon on Tuesday afternoon and met the bereaved families of former MLA late Udai Mudliar and his assistant late Allanoor , expressing heartfelt condolences to them . . . Udai was my family friend . His sudden demise is a shocker for me said Dr Singh while consoling the family of late Udai Mudliar . Singh expressed his grief saying that this family has lost a son and he has lost his brother-like friend in the ferocious act of naxalites . Later , Chief Minister also visited the house of late Allanoor and expressed condolences to his family . Expressing sympathy to the grieve-stricken families , he said that State Government will always be there and stand as a support for them through this difficult moment , and also the time ahead . Meanwhile , Housing and Environment Minister Rajesh Munat and MP Madhusudan Yadav were also present with Chief Minister . . . Dr Singh said that senior leaders of Congress along with Udai Mudliar , Allanoor , several party-workers , police personnel and even the civilians were brutally killed in the audacious naxal attack in Darbha area of Bastar district on May 25 . It was an extremely condemnable and cowardly act of Naxalites . State Government will provide every possible aid to the families of the deceased and the martyrs in the incident , and those found guilty in the investigation of the case will be subjected to strict legal action , asserted Chief Minister Dr Raman Singh . . . .
