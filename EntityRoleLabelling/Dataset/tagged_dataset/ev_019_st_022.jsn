Union Home Ministry sources in New Delhi told The Hindu that the attitude of the State police led to the destruction of some significant evidence , but the abundance of evidence it managed to gather on its own has raised the investigators hopes of cracking the case soon . . . -LSB- A lot of -RSB- evidence , witnesses and material have been collected by the NIA investigators , even while the State police tried to block the central officials initially , a senior official said . . . The NIA allegedly faced similar hostility from the local police in other States too . However , once the NIA roped in the State police , better cooperation was forthcoming . Here -LSB- in Bengal -RSB- also , the State police and NIA officials are working together . . . Political links . . While the investigators and the Home Ministry are reasonably sure that banned militant outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- was involved in the Bardhaman blast , the agencies are exploring possible links between the JMB and All-India Trinamool Congress -LRB- AITC -RRB- leaders . However , the NIA is not in a hurry to summon them before putting together a watertight case , senior officials in Delhi said .",
