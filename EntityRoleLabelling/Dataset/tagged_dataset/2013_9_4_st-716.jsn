    "content": "A series of coordinated evening blasts in Baghdad and other violence killed at least 47 people in Iraq on Tuesday , officials said . Many of those killed were caught up in a string of car bombings that tore through the Iraqi capital early in the evening as residents were out shopping or heading to dinner . Those blasts struck seven different neighbourhoods and claimed at least 33 lives . The killing comes amid a spike in deadly violence in recent months as insurgents try to capitalise on rising sectarian and ethnic tensions . The evenings deadliest single blast struck hit a row of restaurants in the largely Shia eastern neighbourhood of Talibiyah , killing seven and wounding 28 . No one claimed immediate responsibility for the attacks , but coordinated car bombings and attacks on civilians and Iraqi security forces are a favourite tactic of the Iraqi branch of al-Qaeda . It typically does not lay claim to attacks for many days , if at all . The evening blasts added to a death toll that had been mounting throughout the day . Shia and Sunni leaders have both called for calm , hoping to avoid a return to those dark days . But the bloodshed continues , with more than 4,000 people killed over the past five months alone . That includes 804 Iraqis killed just last month , according to U.N. figures released earlier this week . In Baghdads southern suburbs , gunmen stormed the house of a member of a Sunni militia opposed to al-Qaeda , killing him and his wife and three children in a southern suburb of the capital , according to police . The militia , known as the Sahwa , helped U.S. troops fight al-Qaeda at the height of the war and since been a target for hard-line insurgents who consider them traitors . Prominent Sahwa leader Wisam al-Hardan escaped unharmed an assassination attempt on Monday by two suicide bombers , but six of his bodyguards and a bystander were killed . In the southern city of Basra , gunmen shot and killed Sunni cleric Abdul-Karim Mustafa . AP OPEN",
