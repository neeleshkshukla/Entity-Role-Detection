S'Director-General of Police , V. Dinesh Reddy said that a breakthrough was achieved in identifying the persons behind the twin bomb blasts at Dilsukhnagar in the city , but refused to divulge the details saying lest they ( the accused ) bolt away . The blasts , which occurred on February 21 , claimed 18 lives besides causing injuries to scores of others . Replying to questions at a press conference here on Tuesday , Mr. Dinesh Reddy said : We know the persons who carried them out . We are on the job of apprehending them , he added . He was not reeling out the details and keeping it a closely-guarded secret in a bid to spring a surprise on the accused and apprehend them . Reviewing the functioning of police during the last six months , he said intelligence-based anti-extremist operations had yielded good results and there was a 60 per cent decrease in extremist offences . At a recent conference of Left Wing Extremism-affected States held in Delhi , it was unanimously decided to adopt the Andhra Pradesh model in the entire country . OPEN'
