S"Package bombs exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome on Thursday , injuring the two people who opened them , said officials . Police ordered checks at all embassies after a false alarm was also reported at the Ukrainian embassy . No one immediately claimed responsibility , but authorities appeared to discount domestic anarchists or protesters . It 's a wave of terrorism against embassies , something much more worrisome than a single attack , said Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno . He added that Italian authorities were following an international path in their investigations , distinguishing the attack from a fake bomb found earlier this week on a subway in Rome . Last month , suspected Greek radical anarchists sent 14 mail bombs to foreign embassies in Athens including the Swiss as well as to French President Nicolas Sarkozy , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . Nobody was hurt and only two devices exploded , causing no injuries . A group called Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire claimed responsibility . The first bomb on Thursday exploded inside the Swiss embassy at around noon . The man who opened it was hospitalised with serious hand injuries but his life was not in danger , said Swiss Ambassador Bernardino Regazzoni . About three hours later , witnesses outside the Chilean embassy said they heard a blast , sending police to the scene . One person was injured , police said . Rome police chief Francesco Tagliente said a suspicious package at the Ukrainain embassy was a false alarm , but added that all embassies in the Italian capital had been informed of the blasts . There have been growing concerns in Europe about holiday season attacks following a suicide bombing in Sweden and security services ' fears of an assault on a European city modelled on the deadly shooting spree in Mumbai , India . On Tuesday , there was a bomb scare in the Rome subway after authorities discovered a suspicious package with wires and powder under a subway seat . The device ended up being a fake , with police determining there was no trigger mechanism and its the powder was inert , cement-like material . AP OPEN"
