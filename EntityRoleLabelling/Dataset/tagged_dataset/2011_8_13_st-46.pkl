S"Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Friday said that there was definite progress in the July 13 bomb blasts investigation , and that he was regularly updated on the developments . He told journalists that he could n't divulge specific details , but added that various agencies were probing the blasts . One month after the blasts , the Opposition targeted the government for not making any arrests . Mr. Chavan had said that surveillance and wireless systems would be upgraded . A Home Department official said that the government had asked for a detailed plan for upgrading police wireless systems with the latest in the field of communications and technology . A presentation on this was made to the government , and the Director-General of Police had been asked to find a good option . The government had also asked for systems of alternative communication in emergencies , and police teams had visited Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to check out the systems there . A decision could be taken in eight to ten days on the alternative systems . The CCTV bids would also be finalised within three months ; at least 2,000 of them were to be installed by the year end , it is learnt . The government plans to instal CCTVs all over the city to increase surveillance by upgrading the communication network soon . OPEN"
