Neepcos gas-based power plant at Kathalguri went out of business ' experts say it could remain shut for upto seven days ' when militants blew up a pipeline yesterday as part of their pre-Republic Day terror campaign . . . The Assam Gas Company Ltd pipeline carries gas from the oil-collecting station of Oil India Ltd to Neepcos 291-MW power plant , just eight km away , under Duliajan police station . Production at the Neepco plant came to a halt immediately , resulting in a shortfall of 120 MW . The Upper Assam districts have since been experiencing long powercuts . The peak-hour demand is 550 MW . . . Sources said Ulfa militants had first tried to blow up the pipeline at 8.30 pm , but could not cause any damage . They made a second attempt at a different spot , 3 km away , around 11.45 pm . A villager from Bokuloni said the blast was deafening and its impact could be felt within a 10-km radius of the site . . . A senior Neepco official said repairs would take time . An Assam State Electricity Board official echoed him . Dark days lie ahead . . . The blast caused an estimated loss of Rs 2 crore per day to Neepco and Rs 2 lakh a day to Assam Gas company Ltd. . . Ulfa militants triggered another explosion in front of a rice mill at Beganakhowa in Golaghat district at 6.45 pm today , the 15th since Saturday night . Nobody was killed or injured . . . In Jorhat , the police defused a bomb planted near the Tibetan market in the heart of the city . They found 300 grams of RDX connected to a timer . The bomb was set to go off at 8.10 pm , when the market is usually crowded . . . Seven new Ulfa recruits were arrested near Balaji Temple at Lokhra , in Guwahati , last night . The rebels were suspected to be behind the grenade explosion near Zoo Road Tinali .",
