    "content": "The Delhi High Court on Monday ordered a National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) court here to frame the charge of waging war against the Government of India against Wasim Akram Malik facing prosecution in the Delhi High Court blast case . A Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice S.P. Garg ordered framing of the charge , admitting argument by the investigating agency that the intention of the accused was to cause injury to people in general , not to a particular person . The Bench passed the order on a revision petition filed by the investigating agency against the trial court order dropping the charge against the accused . Dropping the charge , Special Judge H.S. Sharma had said : These offences ( relating to waging war against the Government of India ) require something more than the one which is available against the accused in this case . Merely because a bomb had exploded outside the Delhi High Court and in the e-mail , there was a reference of release of Afzal Guru , it does not mean that these offences are made out . In my view , the explosion of the bomb at Gate Number 5 of the Delhi High Court and subsequent assertion of the person sending the e-mail , by itself do not , even for the purpose of framing charges , make out offences . . It can not be said the act had been committed to wage a war against the Government of India , '' Mr. Sharma had further stated . Setting aside his order , the Bench said : The object , purpose and animus as propounded and alleged has to be given weightage and can not be discounted at this stage . The Bench also dismissed argument by the accused that the charge of waging war against the Government of India was attracted only when security forces were specifically targeted . The blast at the Gate Number 5 reception counter of the High Court had claimed 15 lives and injured several others in September last year . OPEN",
