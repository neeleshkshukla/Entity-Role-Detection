A written reply given by Home Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy during question hour said Swami Asimanand and other suspects would be further grilled following the filing of charge sheets . All the accused , who were at large , would also be brought to book . Ms. Reddy said the CBI , which was probing the case , arrested 58 persons , including Swami Asimanand , in 38 cases revolving around the bomb blast . A charge sheet would soon be filed against Devender Gupta and Lokesh Sharma , who were arrested ahead of Swami Asimanand . Ms. Reddy furnished details of the 58 arrested persons and 49 others who were let off as their complicity in the cases was not established . She said the report of the Justice V. Bhaskara Rao Commission , which went into the firing after the blast , would be tabled in the House within six months . OPEN",
