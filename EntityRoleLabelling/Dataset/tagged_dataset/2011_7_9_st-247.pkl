S"The death of 3 fishermen in gelatine sticks blast at Thondi has brought the prevalence of dynamite fishing , ' a destructive and highly dangerous practice , to the fore . Though it has been continuing for several years , this is the first time that the banned practice claimed the life of three persons in the region . Although the district police had booked cases against several persons and arrested many persons involved in dynamite fishing ' in the recent past , it is flourishing in some parts of the district , particularly Thondi . Details of the number of persons involved in the practice are yet to be collected by officials . According to a rough estimate , 2 to 4 per cent of the fishermen in Thondi , Thiruppalakudi and surrounding villages indulge in dynamite fishing ' . The fishermen carry country bombs glass bottles with layers of powdered potassium nitrate and pebbles or ammonium nitrate and kerosene to trigger low-intensity explosion in the sea . Some others generate an explosion using gelatine sticks and other devices . The idea is to create shockwaves under water to stun the fish and damage their swim bladders . The explosions would kill large numbers of fish in a radius of around half-a-kilometre . The dead fish float in the sea . In spite of the high risk , the fishermen adopt the method . OPEN"
