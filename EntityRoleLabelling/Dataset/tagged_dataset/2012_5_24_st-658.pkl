S'Two children were killed and half a dozen persons injured in a powerful bomb blast that rocked Kareli area of Allahabad on Wednesday . The blast occurred in a garbage dump near a nullah under the Kareli Scheme police station area and the victims are rag-pickers . It is suspected that a crude bomb was placed in the dump , and the device went off when it was touched by the kids playing in the area . The basti where the incident took place is inhabited by rag-pickers . Unofficial reports said the blast claimed five lives , including four children and a woman . The explosion occurred at around 3.30 p.m. . A team of Anti-Terrorist Squad ( ATS ) and forensic experts have rushed to Allahabad . State I-G ( Law & Order ) B. P. Singh told journalists that in the morning some rag-pickers had collected the garbage and kept it at the bomb blast site . Some children were playing in the area when the explosion occurred . While two children were killed , four more persons were injured in the blast , the I-G added . One of the deceased has been identified . The injured include two women and two girls in the age group of 11 to 40 years . About the intensity of the blast , the I-G said from the damage caused by the explosion it appeared to be a powerful blast . Regarding the type of the explosive material , Mr. Singh said it would be assessed by the forensic team which has been sent to Allahabad . He added that no specific alert has been sounded in Allahabad or elsewhere . Mr. Singh denied that crude bombs hurled by some anti-social elements caused the explosion . Even as the police officer refused to confirm that a crude bomb was used to trigger off the explosion , he admitted that Allahabad is notorious for manufacture of crude bombs , particularly the old city area . When it was pointed out that a similar blast occurred in Allahabad last year and the victims were three children , Mr. Singh remarked that crude bomb blasts are common in Allahabad . OPEN'
