    "content": "A suicide bomber slaughtered more than 40 people , including five children , when he struck at a mosque in northern Afghanistan after Eid al-Adha prayers on Friday , officials said . It was the worst death toll in a single attack in Afghanistan since 80 died on December 6 last year in a suicide blast at a shrine in Kabul on the Shiite holy day of Ashura . At least 50 others were wounded as the bomb - reportedly stuffed with ball-bearings - ripped through the crowd of worshippers in Maymana city in Faryab province . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but suicide bombings are a favourite weapon of Taliban Islamists trying to topple the Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai . The attacker was wearing a police uniform when he blew himself up at the entrance to the city 's packed Eid Gah mosque , deputy provincial governor Abdul Satar Barez told the press agencyAFP . `` We have 42 dead - more than 20 are security forces and the rest of them are civilians , including five or six children , '' he said . `` Around 51 are wounded , some 15 of them critically injured . '' A member of parliament for Faryab , Naqeebullah Fayeq , who was present during the attack put the death toll at 47 . Barez , like many other provincial officials , was also at the scene at the time of the bombing and described the horror of the blast in the midst of a religious celebration . `` We had just finished Eid al-Adha prayers and we were congratulating and hugging each other , '' Barez said . `` Suddenly a big explosion took place and the area was full of dust and smoke and body parts of police and civilians were all over the place . It was a very powerful explosion . '' One eyewitness , Sayed Moqeed , described the bomber as appearing to be in his early teens . `` Suddenly I heard a very big explosion , '' he said . `` Everywhere were pieces of bodies , hands and limbs . The suicide attacker was in police uniform , he looked to be around 14 or 15 years old . '' Karzai strongly condemned the attack , calling the perpetrators `` the enemies of Islam and humanity '' . `` Those who take the happiness of Muslims during Eid days can not be called human and Muslim , '' he said.AFP OPEN",
