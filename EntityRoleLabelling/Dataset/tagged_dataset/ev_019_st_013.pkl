VIn the wake of the blast in West Bengals Bardhaman district which has raised serious security concerns , it has come to light that the State government has rendered the Security Commission defunct . The Supreme Court had directed setting up of the Commission in 2006 . . . It was in June 2010 that the Left Front Government brought out a gazette notification setting up the West Bengal State Security Commission which shall deliberate on the security concerns of the State among other issues . . . The Commission was to be headed by the Home Minister but the government appointed the then Health Minister , Surjya Kanta Mishra , as its Chairman . In December 2010 , the Supreme Court asked the State government to comply with the order in letter and spirit and appoint Home Minister as its chairperson . . . Commenting on the issue , Dr Mishra , who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly , told The Hindu that he had written to the Governor and as well as the State government pointing out that the Commission was a Constitutional obligation and that it be reconstituted . He said he hasnt received any answer . . . This government feels that having such a functioning commission would undermine its powers to take arbitrary decisions and ensure lack of transparency in its functioning , Dr Mishra added . . . Retired General Sankar Roychowdhury who was the member of the Commission appointed by the Left Front Government also admitted that he had not heard about the Commission since 2010 . . . In my opinion , it was not taken seriously by the Government after 2010 , Mr Roychowdhury said . . . On being contacted , senior Minister Partha Chatterjee , who was the Leader of Opposition in the previous Left Front regime , said he was not aware of the Commission and asked to check the website of the Home Department instead . The website has no mention of the Commission . . . In fact , the government has not responded to RTI queries made by international NGO , Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative -LRB- CHRI -RRB- , which has prepared a report on the functioning of the State Security Commission all across the country . . . Anirudha Nagar , programme officer of CHRI who has worked on the report , said the organisation filed RTI queries in April 2013 to the office of State Director General of Police , which was later transferred to the Home department but no response has come from the government . . . States like Delhi and Kerala have set up the Commission and they hold regular meetings , Mr Nagar added .
