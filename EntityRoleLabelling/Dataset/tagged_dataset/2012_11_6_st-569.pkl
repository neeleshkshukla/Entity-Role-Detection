S'A bomb blast in Bahrain has killed an Indian and injured another , triggering fears of more violence in the absence of any real dialogue between pro-democracy campaigners and the monarchy in the Kingdom . T. Murugaiiyan , hailing from Tamil Nadu , was killed in Gudaibiya area of Manama when he kicked an object wrapped in plastic bag , which blew up . The tragedy occurred when Mr. Murugaiiyan was walking behind his brother who was on the cellphone . Another Indian , Dhannaram Saini , from Rajasthan , a municipality cleaner , lost his palm when he touched an explosive object hidden inside a garbage container in the capitals upscale Adliya district . He was admitted to hospital and his condition was reported to be stable , diplomatic sources said . Mr. Murugaiiyans body would be handed over to his family after completion of formalities , which include clearances from the police and the Health Ministry . The state-run Bahrain News Agency ( BNA ) reported that five serial blasts , caused by homemade devises rocked Manama on Monday . These explosions , described by officials as acts of terrorism , also killed a Bangladeshi national . Violence has been rising in Bahrain , coinciding with the suppression of dissent in the Kingdom . Last month , a bomb explosion killed a policeman while on patrol in the village of al-Akr , where a protest rally was being held . Another succumbed to his injuries sustained after he was attacked with a petrol bomb in April . Last week , the Interior Ministry banned all rallies and public gatherings . At least 60 people , including several policemen have died , and thousands injured or jailed after the Bahraini uprising flared in February 2011 . OPEN'
