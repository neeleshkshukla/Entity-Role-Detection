' I condemn the blast by the Ulfa which has led to the loss of seven precious lives . The Assam government should take determined and strong action against the separatist outfit which are regularly targetting Hindi-speaking people in the north eastern state , ' Nitish said in a statement . He also demanded adequate security for the Hindi-speaking people , including Biharis , who have significant presence in some pockets of the state and were contributing to its development . Seven persons were killed and 30 wounded when Ulfa militants set off a bomb in Athgaon area of Assam . Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , while expressing his shock and profound grief over the killing , demanded immediate Central intervention there . Modi said such a gory incident took place as the state government failed to take preventive action promptly after ULFA issued a threat of a major bomb explosion in Guwahati three days before the incident . He said ULFA chief Paresh Barua had announced awards for killing Hindi speaking people from Dhaka Jail which , too , was not taken up seriously by the Assam government . Modi alleged that Congress had a soft corner for ULFA as the ultra outfit had supported the party during the last elections . He said Biharis living in Assam since long have assimilated themselves with the Assamese society hence they be provided adequate security .",
