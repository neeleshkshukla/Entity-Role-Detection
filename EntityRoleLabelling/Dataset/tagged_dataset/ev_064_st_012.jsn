    "content": ". . For Hitesh Shah , travel by train will never be the same again . At around 6.20 pm , Shah was on a Western Railway foot over-bridge , crossing from Mahim West to the East , when he heard a loud bang . He looked down to see a train moving quickly beneath the bridge , coming to a halt a few seconds later . . . At first , he assumed it was a short circuit that led to the halt . When he took a second look , he saw dead bodies flying out of the Borivali-bound fast train . Blood was flowing like a river all around . ` People were screaming for help and many were jumping out from other compartments . No one knew what was happening , ' he recalls . . . Without fearing for his life , he ran down to the tracks to help people trapped in the train . The first class compartment , where the bomb was placed , had been reduced to a tangled mass of metal in seconds . When the blast occurred , people standing at the platform waiting to board other trains were also swept off their feet . . . People staying around Mahim station soon arrived in large numbers to help the trapped passengers . Heavy rains did n't deter them from the rescue operations . . . ` It was gruesome , ' says Shah . ' I saw mutilated bodies . I do n't think anyone in that compartment could have come out alive . The intensity of the blast was very high . Some people got sheets from their homes to take out the dead . Those who were breathing were immediately rushed to the nearest hospital . ' . . Tulsi Pipe Road , which runs parallel to Mahim station , witnessed another horrifying scene as locals began dumping dead bodies on the street and trying to save the injured with a sense of urgency . Traffic leading to Dharavi was brought to a halt and diverted via Lady Jamshedji Road . . . Locals were seen consoling unknown passengers who could n't believe their near and dear ones were no more . Some women could n't bear the sight and started vomiting on account of the bloodstains on their bodies . Many started walking away from the station after realizing that the trains would not move further . . . ` We stopped many cars and tempos to take the bodies , ' says Rajesh Varma , a local resident of Dharavi . ` Every person on the road was co-operative and there was no sign of the police . ' . . The blast happened on platform 3 , when the train left . Surprisingly , there were four trains at the station at almost the same time when the incident occurred . . . Krishna Mishra , who was in a slow train bound for Borivli , said there was no sign of the police for almost an hour . ` The least they can do at times like this is arrive on time , ' he says . ` Even when they came , they were beating and shooing away rescuers who were helping the injured . ' . . Many locals are angry that the government had done little to save the lives of ordinary people . ` We should not give these terrorists bail . They need to be hanged in public , ' says J Singh , another commuter . ` There is no law and order . These were innocent people who had nothing to do with politics , but they lost their lives .
