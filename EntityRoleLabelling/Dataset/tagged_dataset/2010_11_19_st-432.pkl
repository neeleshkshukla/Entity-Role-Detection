S'The rural police here seized nearly 34 unexploded steel bombs and a cache of explosive substances from Varikkoli-Narikkatteripara in the Nadapauram police stations limits on Thursday . A team of police officers led by Vadakara Superintendent of Police Neeraj Kumar Gupta unearthed the country bombs during a raid carried out in search of explosives following an incident where six suspected activists of the Communist Party of India-Marxist ( CPI-M ) were injured in a bomb explosion inside a thatched shed at Narikkatteripara in the night on Wednesday . The police believe that the explosion occurred as the victims were making the bombs inside the shed . The area had witnessed frequent clashes between the CPI ( M ) and the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML ) soon after the local body polls on October 23 . Five of the injured persons , K.P. Pavilesh , 25 ; C. Nigesh , 27 ; C. Vijith , 20 ; V. Bijesh , 25 and V. Sajith , 24 , have been admitted to the Baby Memorial Hospital in the city while K. Abhilash , 24 , was admitted to a private hospital at Vadakara . The injuries of three persons are reported to be serious . Two of them have lost their palms in the explosion ; one suffered burn-injuries on the abdomen and had critically wounded one of his limbs , the police said . Mr. Gupta said as many as 31 empty steel containers , gunpowder weighing five kg , aluminium powder and potassium chloratean oxidising agent used for making matches and firecrackerswere recovered from the shed . Some of the unexploded bombs were concealed in bags and buckets and also under rocks . Specialists attached to the bomb disposal squad defused the bombs expect one that was covered with blood stains . Samples of the explosive substances have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kannur . Experts also visited the site to gather more details . Raids to continue The raids in the Nadapauram station limits and adjoining areas would continue . A case has been registered in connection with the incident . More clues could be obtained only after questioning the injured persons , the officer said . The police said steel vessels having a volumetric capacity of 250 ml are easily available in market . Jagged pieces of steel could inflict serious injury after explosion . More than a fortnight ago , three personssuspected to be IUML activistswere injured while making bombs in the limits of Kuttiyadi police station limits . The recovery of bombs from the politically and communally sensitive Nadapuram is a big jolt to the ongoing peace initiatives by the State government . It has also raised fears about political parties and fundamentalist outfits manufacturing bombs to trigger clashes in the region prior to the Assembly elections next year .
