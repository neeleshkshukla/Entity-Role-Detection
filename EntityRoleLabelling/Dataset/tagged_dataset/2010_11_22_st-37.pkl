S"Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has directed Development Commissioner K.C. Saha and Director of the General Home Guard U.S. Dutta to jointly probe Sunday 's bomb blast in which eight people , including five children , were killed and 11 others injured in Naxal-hit Aurangabad district . Mr. Kumar also asked Chief Secretary Anoop Mukherjee to ensure adequate compensation to the families of the victims . Superintendent of Police Vivek Raj Singh said the bomb was planted by Maoists at Pachokhar village during the final phase of Assembly elections on Saturday . The Maoists had given a call for the boycott of the polls . The bomb was found by a police team on Saturday , but it was left in a field in the absence of a bomb disposal squad . When the villagers went to the field on Sunday morning , the bomb suddenly exploded , Mr. Singh told PTI . Twelve others who sustained splinter injuries were admitted to various hospitals in Deo and Aurangabad towns . One of them died later , police said . However , the deceased were yet to be identified as angry villagers did not allow the police to approach the field . Efforts were on to pacify the locals , police said . PTI OPEN"
