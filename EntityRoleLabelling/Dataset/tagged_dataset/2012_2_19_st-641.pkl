S"Taking a cue from the Israeli Embassy car blast , a movie vendor allegedly bombed the vehicle of a businessman with a crude explosive device at Pitampura here in a bid to extort Rs .5 crore from him . The police claim to have seized from him a crude bomb and a consignment of potassium sulphide . Loud explosion Pramod Jain was on his way to attend a function along with his family when he heard a loud explosion from the rear end of his car near Lok Vihar in Pitampura on Wednesday . Taking it to be a cracker thrown by some mischievous children , the businessman did not report the matter to the police . The next day , Mr. Jain received a call followed by a text message from an unknown number demanding a ransom of Rs .5 crore . Threatening call The caller threatened to injure him and his members if the demand was not met . Investigations revealed the mobile number used to make the call and send the text message had been procured using forged documents and had been in use since May . The police zeroed in on the user and identified him as Gyanender , an acquaintance of the businessman , who supplied movie DVDs at this residence on rent . Potassium sulphide seized The police then raided Gyanender 's residence and seized potassium sulphide and a crude bomb that explodes on impact . During interrogation , he purportedly disclosed that he had prepared two crude bombs and on Wednesday , tailed the businessman 's car on his motorcycle .
