    "content": "The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against four persons in the 2006 Malegaon Bomb Blast case . The charge sheet , filed in a special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act ( Mcoca ) court here , named Lokesh Sharma , Rajendra Chowdhari , Dhan Singh and Manohar . All four are currently in judicial custody and have been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ) , the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( UAPA ) and the Explosive Substances Act . The charge sheet filed by the NIA may cause embarrassment to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) , which had earlier arrested nine Muslim youths in connection with the case . The CBI had even endorsed the findings of ATS . The explosions in Malegaon had taken place on a night of shab-e-baraat , which is considered auspicious by Muslims , and had left 37 people dead . The charge sheet has not mentioned the names of Swami Aseemanand , Pragnya Thakur and Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit . Aseemanand had , in his confessional statement before magistrate , stated that the blasts were carried out by Hindu right-wing groups , before attempting to backtrack . According to sources in the NIA , the agency may file a supplementary charge sheet with the names of these three accused as well . The NIA has also sought to carry out further investigations against Ramchandra Kalsangra , Sandeep Dange , and Amit Hakla . The charge sheet , which runs into five volumes , was submitted in the court of special judge Prithviraj Chavan . However , the court has yet not taken cognisance of it .
