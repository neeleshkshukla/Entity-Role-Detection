The blasts took 28 lives in 12 hours , raising fears of more trouble over the weekend during the penultimate and last days of Muharram . The attacks in Rawalpindi and Karachi were clearly sectarian , targeting Shia community members gathered in or near ImamBargahs ( Hall for Shia commemoration ceremonies ) . The midnight strike was the deadliest , killing 23 and injuring 62 . In this , a suicide bomber detonatedwhen prevented by security personnel from breaking through the cordon to join a Muharram procession . Earlier in the evening , two people were killed and several injured in two blasts near an ImamBargah in Karachi . The second blast occurred at the same place , resulting in injuries to some journalists covering the first explosion . Consequently , Shia leaders have called for the Army to be called in on the 9 -LCB- + t -RCB- -LCB- + h -RCB- and 10 -LCB- + t -RCB- -LCB- + h -RCB- Muharram days . Wednesday also saw a bomb attack in the Balochistan capital of Quetta in which three soldiers and two civilians were killed . And , in Bannu in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , three security personnel were injured in an ambush . On Thursday , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Shia community and warned of more such strikes . This has heightened concerns for the rest of the Muharram mourning period . And , in Islamabad , an added concern is the security of the dignitaries including four Presidents and one Premier who have converged to attend the D-8 conference .
