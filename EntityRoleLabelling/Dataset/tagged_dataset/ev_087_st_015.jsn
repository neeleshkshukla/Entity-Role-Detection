HuJI , in an email sent to the media , wrote , ` We own the responsibility for today 's blasts at Delhi high court . Our demand is that Mohammed Afzal Guru 's death sentence should be repealed immediately else we would target major high courts and the Supreme Court of India . ' National Investigation Agency chief SC Sinha told reporters it was premature to comment on the veracity of the HuJI email . He , however , added that he was taking the contents of the email seriously as HuJI is a major terror outfit . Afzal Guru was given the death sentence by the Supreme Court in 2004 for his role in the attack on Parliament in 2001 .",
