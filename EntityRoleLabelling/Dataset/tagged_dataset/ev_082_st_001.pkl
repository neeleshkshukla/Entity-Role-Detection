We hope to be able to form some opinion by tomorrow -LSB- Friday -RSB- . He had a review meeting with police top brass and senior State government officials .

Director-General of Police Pranay Sahay said the police had not been able to pinpoint the involvement of any group or outfit in the blasts . Five cases had been registered in connection with the blasts . . . An angle being explored is whether the blasts were the handiwork of forces bent on scuttling the States development . . . The blasts took place hours after results of the by-election to various local bodies were announced . The ruling Left Front swept the poll , winning 74 per cent of the seats . Of the 153 seats to which by-elections were held on September 27 , the Left Front won in 123 , with the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- alone bagging 120 seats .

CPI -LRB- M -RRB- condemns . . New Delhi Special Correspondent writes : . . The CPI -LRB- M -RRB- condemned the forces which carried out the blasts in Agartala . The incident was an attempt to undermine the success of the Left Front government in tackling extremism , it said . . . CPI -LRB- M -RRB- general secretary Prakash Karat said he spoke to Mr. Sarkar on Thursday . . . The Left Front government of Tripura has registered significant success in tackling the extremist groups which resorted to terrorist violence . The explosions must be seen as an attempt to destabilise the situation , the Polit Bureau said in a statement . . . The Polit Bureau conveyed its heartfelt sympathy to the victims and their families . The Centre should extend all help to Tripura in tracking down the culprits , especially in view of the fact that the State had an international border on the three sides .
