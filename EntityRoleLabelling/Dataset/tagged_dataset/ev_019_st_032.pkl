VBurdwan : An unpainted two-storey house with a pink window on the first floor - that was the scene of the blast in West Bengal 's Burdwan on Thursday in which two suspected militants were killed and a third injured.Alima and Rumi , the wives of one of the injured and one of the dead , have been arrested . When they moved into the first floor flat at Burdwan 's Khargagarh area four months ago , they apparently told the landlord they were in the burqa-making business . But what they allegedly made here instead , were bombs.A narrow grilled doorway is the only way up to the first floor . When police and firemen rushed here after the blast , the two women allegedly barred them from entering the flat where the explosion had occurred and used the time to allegedly burn incriminating material , including pamphlets that mentioned Al Qaeda chief Ayman al Zawahari and the words `` Mujahedeen '' and `` Chechen Rebels '' . Almost overshadowing investigations is the political row between the Trinamool and the CPM and the BJP over the incident . The opposition parties want the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- to probe the blast and not the state police . They allege there are links between the ruling party and the people behind the blast.These allegations have emerged from the fact that a Trinamool supporter owns the building , and Trinamool flags were found inside a room on the ground floor . The Trinamool denies any links . Party MP Mukul Roy says there was no Trinamool office in the building . However , local party leaders have said on record that they used the ground floor room during elections.Police suspect a Bangladeshi link and that the suspected terrorists may have had connections with militant groups across the border.A lot of answers could come from the two women arrested and under interrogations . But , according to reports , the women are not giving anything away . One of the women reportedly told her interrogators that she could kill people . .
