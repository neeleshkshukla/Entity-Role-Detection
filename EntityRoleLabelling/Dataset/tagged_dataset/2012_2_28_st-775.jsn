According to Thai media , mobile telephone call logs showed he had been in regular contact with two Iranians now in custody , one of whom was badly hurt as he hurled a bomb at police while fleeing . An Iranian couple were also taken in for questioning but were later released because police found nothing to indicate they were involved . AFP OPEN",
