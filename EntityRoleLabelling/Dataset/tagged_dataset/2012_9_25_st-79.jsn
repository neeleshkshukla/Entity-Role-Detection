    "content": "Abdul Nazir Maudany , accused in the 2008 Bangalore serial bomb blast case on Monday moved the Karnataka High Court seeking bail on medical grounds . Justice H.N. Nagmohandas , before whom the petition came up for hearing , adjourned hearing to September 26 . Maudany was arrested in Kerala in August 2010 , and is lodged in the Bangalore Central Jail . Last year , the High Court had refused to grant him bail while holding that it would put the security of the State and the nation in jeopardy . However , the court had asked the prison authorities to provide necessary medical treatment to him as he has been suffering from different ailments . Later , even the Supreme Court had denied him bail but directed the Karnataka government to provide him treatment in Bangalore from a Kerala-based ayurvedic medical treatment centre . Bail denied Meanwhile , the High Court on Monday rejected the plea for release on bail by another accused , Abdul Khadar , in the serial blasts case . Khadar , who is accused number 27 in these cases , had sought release on bail claiming that he was falsely implicated by the police . The trail court in Bangalore had already rejected his bail plea on February 25 , 2012 . When the plea came up for hearing on Monday , the High Court did not find merit in his petition . OPEN",
