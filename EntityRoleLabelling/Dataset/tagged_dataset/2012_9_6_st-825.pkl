S'Two security personnel were injured in a bomb blast triggered Wednesday by suspected militants in the Manipur capital , police said . A security alert has been sounded . The two Assam Rifles troopers were on routine patrolling when the blast hit them in the Keisampat area , a few kilometres from the Manipur Police headquarters . Their condition is stated to be stable , an Assam Rifles official said . A security alert has been sounded and Keisampat has been cordoned off , Imphal district police chief Konsam Jayanta Singh told IANS . He said preliminary reports suggested that the blast could have been triggered by an Improvised Explosive Device . We have found the wreckage of a scooter from the blast site , he said . No arrests had been made so far , he added . Though no rebel group has claimed responsibility for the blasts , Manipur Police and intelligence officials said the blasts were carried out by rebels . On Monday , a youth was killed in a village of Manipurs Thoubal district after a bomb , suspected to have been planted by militants , went off at his house . There are more than 20 rebel outfits in Manipur with demands ranging from secession to greater autonomy.IANS OPEN'
