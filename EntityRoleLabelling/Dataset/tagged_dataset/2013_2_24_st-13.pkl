S'After the twin blasts in Hyderabad , the people of Karimnagar district are a worried lot over their safety at the heavily-crowded APSRTC bus station in Karimnagar , from where over one lakh commuters travel to various destinations everyday . The same bus station complex had witnessed a powerful bomb blast at platform number 6 on August 9 , 2005 , injuring at least 21 commuters and damaging three buses and some shops in the vicinity . At that time , the police had stated that the bomb had been kept in a tiffin box and the chemical substance used in the bomb was nitro-glycerine mixed with iron pellets and splinters . After some investigation , the police stated that the blast could be the handiwork of some fundamentalist outfits but neither identified the terrorist group nor the persons involved in the incident . The case was later handed over to the Crime Investigation Department ( CID ) . After that , there was no further investigation into it . After the bomb blast , following persistent pleas by local commuters , the RTC authorities had installed CCTV cameras to keep a close surveillance . Besides , a police outpost was also opened . But despite these measures , several incidents of robberies and stealing have taken place , and the commuters still fear that there is no safety for them during the peak hours . Surveillance However , the RTC authorities aver that close surveillance is being observed with a sub-inspector of police as incharge along with home guards . We have deployed 12 CCTV cameras at vantage points to oversee security arrangements , they said . The commuters , on the other hand , argue that the installation of CCTVs alone was not sufficient . There should be constant surveillance with police in uniform moving frequently . The existing outpost with one policeman and a home guard was not sufficient to monitor security of a huge bus station complex , said a passenger . A bomb blast took place at the bus stand in 2005 injuring at least 21 commutersDespite measures taken by RTC authorities , it is a safe haven for illegal activities , feel people A bomb blast took place at the bus stand in 2005 injuring at least 21 commuters Despite measures taken by RTC authorities , it is a safe haven for illegal activities , feel people OPEN'
