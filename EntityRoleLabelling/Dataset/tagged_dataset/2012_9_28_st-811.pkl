S"Two bombs struck the Syrian army headquarters in the heart of Damascus on Wednesday , as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appealed for the `` paralyzed '' UN Security Council to find a way to end the conflict . The attack on the heavily guarded site killed four guards and sparked a gun battle between troops and rebels , Syrian state media said.A rebel officer and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was an inside job , while an Islamist rebel group said its men carried out the attack , and five of its fighters including a suicide bomber died during the assault . The claims were impossible to verify . According to the army , `` terrorist groups '' with foreign affiliations `` carried out a new act of terrorism by detonating a car bomb and another device on the edge of the general staff compound . '' The regime of President Bashar al-Assad blames unrest and violence on foreign-backed terrorist gangs . All senior commanders and other officers were safe and uninjured , the statement read . State television showed video footage of a white van exploding beside the military headquarters , and a second blast inside the compound.AFP OPEN"
