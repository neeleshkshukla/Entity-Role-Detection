VNational Blast accused brought to Delhi . . Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : Two persons , whom the the Delhi police picked up from Jammu and Kashmir in connection with the October 29 bomb blasts here , have been brought to the Capital . . . While one of them has been remanded to 14-day police custody on Thursday , the police remained tight-lipped about the other detainee . . . It is learnt that around 5 p.m. on Thursday , one of the accused , identified as Ghulam Mohammad Khan , was produced in court . The police claimed that Ghulam was one of the peripheral links of the Lashkar-e-Taiba , which is suspected to be behind the blasts . A probe into his bank account reportedly idicated that in the past three months , he had sent about Rs . 66 lakhs , apparently through a Middle-East country . The police suspect that like Tariq Ahmed Dar , the alleged conduit arrested earlier in Srinagar for his involvement in the Delhi blasts , Ghulam was also used to disburse money among the militants . . . Tariq will be produced in court on Friday .
