S"A bomb attack tore through a Pakistan army vehicle escorting children from school on Wednesday , killing four soldiers and a woman in the southwestern city of Quetta , police said . More than 20 people were wounded in the attack , one day before Pakistan welcomes Muslim leaders at the Developing Eight summit in the capital , where international conferences are rare due to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked violence plaguing the country . `` The target was an army vehicle which was escorting a school bus carrying children of local army officers from different schools , '' Quetta city police chief Hamid Shakeel told AFP . He said four soldiers and a woman were killed when the bomb was detonated by remote control . `` Twenty-one people were wounded in the blast , including three soldiers . Eighteen are civilians . Six or seven of them are in a serious condition , '' he said . `` It was a remote controlled bomb . The device was planted on a motorbike . It exploded soon after the army vehicle came there , '' Shakeel said . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday 's attack , but Quetta and its province Baluchistan are frequently hit by bomb attacks.AFP OPEN"
