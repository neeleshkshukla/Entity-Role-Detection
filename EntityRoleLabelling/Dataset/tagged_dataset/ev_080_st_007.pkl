Two of the wounded were in critical condition at a hospital in the predominantly Mulsim town of Modasa in western Gujarat state , a police officer said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters . . . Two people on a motorbike dropped a bag containing explosives on a road in the market and fled , the officer said . . . No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack . . . A series of blasts have rocked Indian cities and killed more than 140 people since November . . .
