The Centre is yet to take a decision on handing over the case to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- . . . Given that the West Bengal Police have invoked the Unlawful Activities -LRB- Prevention -RRB- Act provisions pertaining to allegations of terror act , conspiracy , organising terror training camps and harbouring , the case falls within NIA jurisdiction . . . Scheduled Offences . . The Act is among the laws listed in the Scheduled Offences category of the NIA Act , empowering the agency to conduct the investigation . . .
