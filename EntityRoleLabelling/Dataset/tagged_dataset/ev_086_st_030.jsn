    "content": "Mumbai : Senior BJP leader LK Advani , who is in Mumbai , blamed the Mumbai attacks today on `` a policy failure '' by the UPA government.Home Minister P Chidambaram said this morning that the serial blasts in Mumbai last evening can not be described as an intelligence failure . Mr Advani countered , `` It is not an intelligence failure ... I do n't accuse the government of that ... it is a policy failure . `` So far , 17 people have died ; 131 were injured in the three blasts that took place within twelve minutes during rush hour last evening . The BJP leader visited the sites of the trio of blasts this morning ; he also spent some time in two hospitals where those injured are being treated . He urged the government to adopt a `` zero-tolerance policy on terror . `` He also said that `` Mumbai has become a favourite target of terrorists - whether they are from neighbouring countries or from here . '' Mr Advani said that there are reports that the Indian Mujahideen - an indigenous terror group - may have been responsible for the latest attacks . The Home Minister categorically said this morning that it would be irresponsible right now to speculate on who is to blame . `` Even if Indian Mujahideen caused these new blasts , they get their support from Pakistan , '' Mr Advani said . `` As far as India is concerned , the government must shed its ambivalence towards terrorism , '' he added . `` It must be categorical in declaring that total policy of India towards terrorism hereafter shall be of zero-tolerance . . we will not tolerate anything which seems to promote or condone or compromise or disregard any terrorist activity . This should be a basic premise of our relationship with Pak - that it will have to dismantle the infrastructure that it has created for terror , '' he said . .",
