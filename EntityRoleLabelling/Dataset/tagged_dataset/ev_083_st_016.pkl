VThey said that just one look at the bodies of the dead hostages as well as terrorists showed it was a battle of attrition that was fought over three days at the Oberoi and the Taj hotels in Mumbai . . . Doctors working in a hospital where all the bodies , including that of the terrorists , were taken said they had not seen anything like this in their lives . . . ` Bombay has a long history of terror . I have seen bodies of riot victims , gang war and previous terror attacks like bomb blasts . But this was entirely different . It was shocking and disturbing , ' a doctor said . . . Asked what was different about the victims of the incident , another doctor said : ` It was very strange . I have seen so many dead bodies in my life , and was yet traumatised . A bomb blast victim 's body might have been torn apart and could be a very disturbing sight . But the bodies of the victims in this attack bore such signs about the kind of violence of urban warfare that I am still unable to put my thoughts to words , ' he said . . . Asked specifically if he was talking of torture marks , he said : ` It was apparent that most of the dead were tortured . What shocked me were the telltale signs showing clearly how the hostages were executed in cold blood , ' one doctor said . . . The other doctor , who had also conducted the post-mortem of the victims , said : ` Of all the bodies , the Israeli victims bore the maximum torture marks . It was clear that they were killed on the 26th itself . It was obvious that they were tied up and tortured before they were killed . It was so bad that I do not want to go over the details even in my head again , ' he said . . . Corroborating the doctors ' claims about torture was the information that the Intelligence Bureau had about the terror plan . ` During his interrogation , Ajmal Kamal said they were specifically asked to target the foreigners , especially the Israelis , ' an IB source said . . . It is also said that the Israeli hostages were killed on the first day as keeping them hostage for too long would have focused too much international attention . ` They also might have feared the chances of Israeli security agencies taking over the operations at the Nariman House , ' he reasoned . . . On the other hand , there is enough to suggest that the terrorists also did not meet a clean , death . . . The doctors who conducted the post mortem said the bodies of the terrorists were beyond recognition . ` Their faces were beyond recognition . ' . . There was no way of identifying them , ' he said . Asked how , if this is the case , they knew the bodies were indeed those of the terrorists , he said : ` The security forces that brought the bodies told us that those were the bodies of the terrorists , ' he said , adding there was no other way they could have identified the bodies . . . An intelligence agency source added : ` One of the terrorists was shot through either eye . ' . . A senior National Security Guard officer , who had earlier explained the operation in detail to rediff.com , said the commandos went all out after they ascertained that there were no more hostages left . When asked if the commandos attempted to capture them alive at that stage , he replied : ` Unko bachana kaun chahega -LRB- Who will want to save them -RRB- ? ' .
