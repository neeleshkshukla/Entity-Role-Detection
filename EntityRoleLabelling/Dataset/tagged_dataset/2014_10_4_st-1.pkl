S"Several investigating agencies such as the Special Task Force ( STF ) of the Kolkata Police , the Anti-Terrorism Squad and West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) collected samples on Friday from a house - in the Bardhaman district of West Bengal - where two persons died in an explosion . The explosion took place on Thursday at a house in Khagragarh in the district . Two persons - Shakil Ahmad and Sovon Mondal - died on the spot . The police have seized some explosives and other `` evidence '' from the house which suggests that the deceased may have had links to terror outfits , the district police claimed . Although , no arrests have been made , the police are questioning the wives of the deceased along with the owner of the house where the explosion occurred . A few months ago , Hasan Chowdhury had given the house on rent to Shakil Ahmad , a resident of Nadia district . Hasan Sahed , who hails from Murshidabad , was also injured in the explosion . The locals heard a loud explosion at about noon on Thursday and informed the police . The bomb disposal squad and fire tenders were rushed to the spot . Though , it is not clear how the explosion occurred , a number of mobile SIM cards and watch dials were found from the site where the explosion occurred , the police said . OPEN"
