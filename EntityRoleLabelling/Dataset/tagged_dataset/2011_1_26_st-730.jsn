    "content": "President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday called terrorism Russia 's top security threat and slammed the chaotic state of security at Domodedovo airport where 35 people died in a suicide bomb attack on Monday . The number of wounded in the bombing climbed to 180 on Tuesday . Of the 110 people admitted to hospital , 32 were in grave condition and three were critical , said health officials . Eight foreigners died in the attack , including nationals of Britain , Germany , Bulgaria , and some former Soviet states . Terrorism remains the main security threat to our state , to Russia , to all our people said Mr. Medvedev in a televised address . The Russian leader blasted the government for allowing security at Domodedovo airport to slip into a state of anarchy and called for officials responsible for transport security to be dismissed or face sanctions for negligence . An unnamed investigator said a man in his 30s is believed to have set off a powerful bomb in the crowded international arrival section of Domodedovo on Monday afternoon . The source denied earlier reports that a black widow was responsible for the blast . Police were also reported to be looking for the bomber 's three accomplices spotted on CCTV footage . A source in security services told the RIA Novosti news agency they had been tipped off about the planned suicide bombing , but failed to prevent it . Another report said the Domodedovo bomber could belong to a group of terrorists who arrived in Moscow on New Year eve . A woman member of the group died in an accidental blast in a Moscow sports club on December 31 that went largely unnoticed . OPEN",
