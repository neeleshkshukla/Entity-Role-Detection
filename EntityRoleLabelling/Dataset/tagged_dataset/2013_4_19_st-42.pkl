S'Hinting at some headway in Wednesdays Bangalore blast case , Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde has said investigating agencies have tracked down the owners of the motorcycle on which the bomb was planted just outside the Karnataka BJP office here . However , no one has been arrested so far . The Karnataka police , assisted by their Tamil Nadu counterparts , found that the bike with a Tamil Nadu registration number , had changed hands thrice . The police located all three persons who had used the bike since it was first sold . They were being questioned , Mr. Shinde told journalists here on Thursday . We have not come to any conclusion about the people behind the blast . Investigation is such a matter that we can not say we can do within a definite period of time . But I assure the nation that we will book the culprits , we will book the perpetrators . The Minister said the Centre had been alerting all States for the last two-three months about possible terror attacks , particularly in metro cities . However , no specific alert had been issued to any State about the possibility of a religious place being targeted . Whenever we have any specific information , we immediately share it with the State concerned . OPEN'
