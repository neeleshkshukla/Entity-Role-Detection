    "content": "A day after the murder of suspected Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) operative Mohammad Qateel Siddiqui in the Yerwada jail here , a definite reason is yet to emerge . While the two jail inmates accused of the killing , Sharad Mohol and Amol Bhalerao , were arrested by the Yerwada police on Saturday , Siddiqui 's relatives accused the Maharashtra Anti-terrorism Sqaud ( ATS ) of foul play . In Pune to collect Siddiqui 's body , his cousin Mohammad Afroz stated that he had lost faith in the police machinery . What had he done ? The police could not prove anything . They had him for six months , he stated . He was murdered inside the jail while the ATS was in-charge of him . You can understand who wanted him killed , Mr Afroz said , suggesting that the ATS was responsible for Siddiqui 's murder . He stated that he had not been given the body by Saturday evening . Siddiqui was allegedly murdered by Mohol and Bhalerao on Fridaymorning . While ATS sources stated that the duo killed him because he was involved in anti-national activities , there are speculations that it might have been a IM hit job , as Siddiqui was being touted as the link to IM mastermind Yasin Bhatkal . Accused in the Bangalore Chinnaswamy stadium blast case and in the Delhi Jama Masjid blast case , he was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police in November 2011 . He was later brought to Pune by the ATS in May to probe his involvement in the foiled bid to bomb a temple in Pune . According to the ATS , Siddiqui had confessed to being a part of the conspiracy to plant a bomb outside Pune 's Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple on February 13 , 2010 , along with Yasin Bhatkal . Bhatkal is wanted in several other terror cases in the country , including Pune 's German Bakery Blast case . However , the ATS refused to comment on the IM link in Siddiqui 's murder . Meanwhile , the Yerwada police arrested Mohol and Bhalerao from the jail . They will be produced in court tomorrow . We will ask for police custody after which we will know the reason for the murder duringinvestigation , Police Inspector Kishore Jadhav stated . OPEN",
