VDIBRUGARH : Suspected militants detonated a bomb killing a teenage girl and injuring 17 people , including a woman , in upper Assam 's tea town Dibrugarh on Tuesday . The explosive , probably a crude bomb , went off at around 5pm behind the old railway station in the busy Amolapatty area below an electric pole , district superintendent of police Rana Bhuyan told PTI . 14-year-old Purnima Rojok , who had been injured in the blast , succumbed to her wounds at the Assam Medical College Hospital . Seventeen others injured , some of them critically , have also been admitted to the hospital . Preliminary investigations pointed to a crude bomb and not a grenade as no splinters were found at the site of the blast and also there was no trace of an improvised explosive device -LRB- IED -RRB- , Bhuyan said . The explosion created a two-feet wide crater on the road , the sources said . The identity of the insurgent outfit responsible for the blast was not immediately known , the SP said . Both ULFA -LRB- Independent -RRB- and Maoist elements are known to be active in upper Assam . Local people had reported to the police that two extremists had come on a motorcycle and hurled a grenade before fleeing . Senior police officials went to the site , cordoned off the area , and tightened security arrangements in the town . Earlier on December 15 , a grenade was exploded by suspected anti-talk NDFB -LRB- Songbijit -RRB- at Molandubi Market in Kokrajhar district killing one person and injuring four others .
