    "content": "March 7 : The political leadership scrambled tonight to prevent a repeat of Gujarat after serial blasts killed at least 15 people in Varanasi , one of the most renowned pilgrimage cities in the world . . . The Prime Minister led the chorus of appeals for calm and despatched additional security forces to Uttar Pradesh while Sonia Gandhi rushed to Varanasi with the home minister . . . The first explosion occurred in the packed Sankat Mochan temple near Benaras Hindu University . Hundreds of pilgrims were in the temple as Tuesdays are considered particularly holy by devotees of Hanuman , the deity of the Sankat Mochan shrine . . . Some Hindus believe that Sankat Mochan is second in importance only to the Viswanath Mandir , the holiest of Hindu shrines . . . Two other explosions rocked the Cantonment railway station ' one inside the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi and another in a waiting hall . . . The break-up of the casualty figure was not available but police said it seemed higher at the station . At least 100 people were injured . . . Six bombs were found from other areas in the city , including in a restaurant frequented by foreigners . . . In the temple , the bomb was placed in a container near a gate where women usually sit . When the bomb went off , an elderly couple was waiting to offer prayers for their newly-wed daughter and her husband . . . I was about 100 feet away . I could see hands and legs flying in the air , said Kaushik Kishore , a student of Benaras Hindu University . . . No group claimed responsibility for the blasts and officials said it was too early to pin blame . . . In Delhi , the political and administrative machinery worked overtime to prevent a backlash , especially since Holi is only a week away and preliminary investigation suggested that the explosions bore similarities to the pre-Diwali blasts that rocked the capital last year . . . Security has been stepped up across sensitive spots in the country and the government signalled that its priority is to ensure that no Gujarat-like flare-up occurred anywhere . . . Five companies of CRPF have been sent to Uttar Pradesh , on the boil following protests over cartoons and the visit of US President George W. Bush . The BJP and the VHP have called for a bandh in Uttar Pradesh tomorrow . . . Sonia left for Varanasi after a meeting with Congress leaders . At this moment , while all efforts are being made to identify those behind this dastardly deed , we must do our utmost to maintain social harmony and peace , she said in a message . . . The Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind and the Indian Union Muslim League condemned the blasts .",
