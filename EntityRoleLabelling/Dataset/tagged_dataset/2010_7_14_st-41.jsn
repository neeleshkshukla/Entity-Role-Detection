The remnants of the explosives and the Scooty which together with two motorcycles were damaged in the fire caused by the blast have been sent to Agra for examination by a team of the Forensic Science Laboratory . The vehicle 's chassis number was found erased . A First Information Report , under Section 307 of the IPC and Section 3/4 of the Explosive Act , has been filed at the Kotwali police station . Six persons , including Mr. Nandi , were injured in the blast near the Institutional Finance Minister 's residence at Bahadurganj . Rakesh Malviya , one of those who were with the Minister when the blast occurred , died of injuries . The post-mortem was conducted on Tuesday . On Monday , Additional Director-General ( Law and Order ) Brij Lal denied that the blast claimed a life , but he confirmed Malviya 's death on Tuesday . Mr. Nandi was shifted to the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow on Monday night , and his condition is said to be stable . However , the condition of his police gunner , Sanjay , and that of the Allahabad correspondent of an English daily was critical . The bomb , thought to have been kept in a two-wheeler parked near Mr. Nandi 's residence , was triggered by a remote control device . The investigating teams were uncertain about the type of explosives used . Mr. Lal ruled out the involvement of Maoists in the attack . OPEN",
