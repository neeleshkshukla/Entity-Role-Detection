At that time we had reports of six people being seriously injured , said Ajay Kashyap , joint commissioner ( southern range ) . My brother , Sanjay , was injured in the blast .

The toll stands at 1 dead and 18 injured.Mayor of Delhi , Aarti Mehta , has dubbed the blasts in Mehrauli as shameful.Mehta said that security of people is the top most priority at the moment .
