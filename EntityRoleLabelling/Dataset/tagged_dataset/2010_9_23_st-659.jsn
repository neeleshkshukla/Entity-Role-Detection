This bomb was a time-bomb planted on a tree among the people and it went off at 10:20 a.m. , the website of state-run television IRIB quoted a military official as saying . The blast on Wednesday took place about 50 metres from the parade . None of the soldiers were injured , but the spectators , mostly women and children , were the chief victims of the attack . Iran 's Mehr news agency said wives of two ranking military officers were among the dead . State television showed a short video of soldiers marching in front of the VIP stand at when the bomb went off . Soon after the loud bang , the area was littered with debris , pieces of broken furniture , bits of clothing and footwear . Vahid Jalalzadeh , the Governor of West Azerbaijan province , blamed counter-revolutionary groups for the strike . While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack , Kurdish separatists have been active in West Azerbaijan , which borders Turkey and Iraq . Mahabad was once the capital of the self-proclaimed republic of Iranian Kurdistan . Iran recaptured Mahabad in 1946 . Wednesday 's carnage follows an August 4 attack , which appeared to target Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's motorcade , heading towards the western city of Hamadan . In Tehran , the armed forces chief accused the United States of supporting anti-government groups inside Iran . Several military parades were held on Wednesday across Iran to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Iran-Iraq war which began on September 22 . These ceremonies are part of the Sacred Defence Week that is being observed throughout Iran . OPEN",
