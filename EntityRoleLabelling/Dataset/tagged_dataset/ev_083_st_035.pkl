VMumbai : Three police officers , including chief of ATS Hemant Karkare , encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and additional commissioner Ashok Kamte succumbed to their injuries in Wednesday 's terror attack . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Karkare , IPS officer of the 1982 batch , had served in RAW for nine years and was made the ATS chief in January this year . He had solved the serial bomb blasts in Thane , Vashi and Panvel . The credit for the stunning revelations in the investigation of the September 29 blast in Malegaon goes to his credit . Karkare is known for his discipline and fair investigation . During the Malegaon investigation , Karkare had told his officers not to create false evidence , saying , ` We have done our job and it is for the court to decide . ' Vijay Salaskar , officer of the 1983 batch , had till recently killed around 75 dreaded criminals in police encounters . After being out of the spotlight for quite sometime , the encounter specialist was given the plum posting of heading the anti-extortion wing of the crime branch.Ashok Kamte was the DCP , Zone 1 , in Mumbai and was also the key officer in state police . He had also served as the commissioner of Solapur and was always known to be in the thick of action . QnA | By putting their lives on the line , do you think the chief cops left their juniors without a leader , causing even more mayhem that could have otherwise been avoided ? .
