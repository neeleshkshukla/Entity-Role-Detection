He lauded the police administration for a proper and fast investigation . . . Two persons were killed and another was injured in the blast . . . Earlier in the day , the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- charged the Trinamool with having links with the blast . . . How do we know if the BJP and the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- are not linked with the blast and is trying to create unrest in the State ? Mr. Roy asked . He alleged that the Opposition was making irresponsible comments . Biman Bose , CPI -LRB- M -RRB- State secretary , and the BJP are trying to disturb the peace and thus denigrate the government ... by making irresponsible statements . . . Denying the allegation that the house where the blast occurred had a Trinamool office , Mr. Roy said it must be substantiated . . . Local people would have known , if the house had the Trinamool office . Electronic media would have filmed ... do you have any footage that establishes that the house had -LRB- party -RRB- office , he asked . . . One may cook any allegation but it has to be substantiated . In the Babri Masjid demolition case , many allegations were made against BJP leaders , but nothing materialised , he said . . . BJP charge . . BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said at a press conference in Delhi that Bangladeshi infiltrators had rented the housed . Mr. Singh said : The local police destroyed all evidence to cover up the incident so that the Trinamool remained above suspicion . . . The local police collected samples and destroyed it within seven hours . The evidence included mobile phones , ID , IM proofs and al-Qaedas jihadi literature . Since the Central forces were informed late , they could not reach on time . All these raise questions on the Mamata Banerjee government , Mr. Singh said . . . Central agency sources told The Hindu that their officials were not allowed entry into the house even two days after the explosion . However , West Bengal Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee denied non-cooperation with the Central agencies . . . West Bengal Left Front committee chairperson Biman Basu quoted newspaper reports to say pamphlets of banned Muslim fundamentalist organisation were recovered from the house . Later , the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- said in a statement that the Trinamool office was located in the house . Soon after the explosion , the signboard of the Trinamool Congress was removed ... local people alleged that that the police tried to block the probe initially , Mr. Bose said .",
