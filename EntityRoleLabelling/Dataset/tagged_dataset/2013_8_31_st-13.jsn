    "content": "The reported admission of Muhammed Ahmed Zaraar Siddibappa alias Yasin Bhatkal , the prime suspect in the Dilsukhnagar twin blasts , of taking shelter in a building 45 minutes from the explosion sites , has sent the local police scurrying around to identify what might have been his possible hideout . Officials and teams of the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) and the Counter Intelligence ( CI ) from the State are trying to verify Yasins claim that he was in Hyderabad before the February 21 bombings , and hid in a building located 10 to 15 km away from Dilsukhnagar . Video footage During the initial stages of the probe into the blasts , video footages recorded by a traffic surveillance camera and the secret camera of a cloth store became crucial leads . A suspect , believed to be Yasin , was seen pedalling a bicycle and carrying an Improvised Explosive Device ( IED ) hidden in a bag and strapped to the carrier . Based on the direction of the cyclists movement , investigators tried to ascertain the direction of his arrival . Video footages recorded by traffic and private cameras in all routes passing through Dilsukhnagar were also checked , but were of no avail . CI and NIA teams say the State police teams would get an opportunity to question Yasin , either late on Friday night or on Saturday morning . Police could then reconstruct the Dilsukhnagar explosions , Yasins role and how members of his module had executed the terror plot . State Intelligence officials have inputs that nearly 10 members of different IM modules had visited the city . Who were they ? Was there any local support ? Whom did Yasin coordinate with while operating from abroad all these years ? These are part of our questionnaire , police said . IM founder Yasin Bhatkal reportedly tells interrogators that he was in Hyderabad in February , to carry out the Dilsukhnagar bombings OPEN",
