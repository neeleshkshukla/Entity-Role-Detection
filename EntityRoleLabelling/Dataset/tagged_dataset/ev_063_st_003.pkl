VStaff Reporter . . Sequel to serial explosions in Srinagar and at Jama Masjid in Delhi . . HYDERABAD : Security was beefed up at important religious places in and around the city as serial blasts rocked Jammu and Kashmir and Jama Masjid in New Delhi on Friday . Patrolling was intensified near prayer halls , temples and mosques . . . Sniffer dogs were brought to Mecca Masjid and other religious places in Old City to identify suspicious objects . Bomb detection squads were also pressed into service . While police higher-ups kept additional forces ready to meet any eventuality , the explosions in northern parts of the country absolutely had no effect in the State capital , especially in the communally sensitive old city . Friday being a holiday , all roads near Charminar bustled with shoppers unmindful of the blasts . . . Alert sounded . . The Hyderabad and Cyberabad police were put on high alert . ` Though persons behind the serial blasts are yet to be identified , we did n't want to take any chance since Hyderabad was targeted by some terrorist groups earlier , ' a police officer said . A watch was kept on all suspects connected with terrorist groups .
