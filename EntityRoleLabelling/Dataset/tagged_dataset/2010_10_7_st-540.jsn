    "content": "The Paryavarana Parirakshana Sangham ( PPS ) on Wednesday decided to organise a rally in Hyderabad , seeking a CBI probe into the bomb blast in Sompeta two weeks ago . PPS president Y. Krishna Murthy and general secretary B. Dhilli Rao alleged that the government failed to identify the culprits who had planted the bomb in the hospital . The government should arrest the culprits immediately and take stern action against them . It should order a CBI inquiry also to expose the persons behind the conspiracy , they said . They said that the PPS had been making arrangements for the rally in the State Capital along with other civil society groups . The PPS leaders , who have been opposing construction of a power plant in Sompeta , said that they suspect a conspiracy to eliminate the agitators physically so that others would not join the movement . The PPS also decided to stage a rasta roko on the National Highway near Sompeta , as Revenue Minister Dharmana Prasada Rao was scheduled to participate in government functions on October 11 in Itchapuram .
