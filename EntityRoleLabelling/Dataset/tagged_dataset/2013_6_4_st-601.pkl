S'A suicide bomber targeting an American military delegation outside a government office in eastern Afghanistan killed 12 people on Monday , including nine schoolchildren who were walking nearby and two international service members , officials said . The attack comes as the Taliban and other militants step up bombings and raids on police posts nationwide in a major test of the ability of Afghan soldiers and police to hold their ground without international military forces , who are withdrawing . General Zelmia Oryakhail , provincial police chief of Paktia province , said the bomber on a motorcycle detonated his explosives in Samkani district as American forces passed . He said a local school had just let pupils , who were between 10 and 16 years old , out for the day . The U.S. military delegation had just attended a security briefing at the district administrative office , said district chief Saleh Mohammad Ahsas , who was in the meeting . He said the bomber appeared to have been waiting for the delegation and struck as the Americans left the compound , and the blast killed people walking nearby including the schoolchildren . The U.S. military coalition in Afghanistan confirmed that two of its service members died in the explosion . It did not disclose their nationalities . Officials gave conflicting initial reports on the death toll , but Gen. Oryakhail said late Monday he had accounted for all the bodies many burned beyond recognition and the final count was one policeman and nine dead from the school , along with the two coalition troops . Seven more civilians , including two children , were killed on Monday in the eastern province of Laghman when their vehicle hit a bomb in the road . As the 2014 withdrawal of most international forces looms , insurgents are intensifying their attacks using a broad range of tactics from suicide bombings to improvised bombs that are often accidentally detonated by passing vehicles , killing civilians .
