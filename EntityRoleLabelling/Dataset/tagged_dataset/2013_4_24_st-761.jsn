But back home in the city after what he describes as an experience of a lifetime , Dr. Muralidhar Nannapaneni is a picture of unflappable spirit despite being shocked at the terror attack . The most priceless souvenirs being the Boston Marathon jerseys ! Well , if I am asked to run the Boston Marathon next week again I am ready for that , says the 43-year-old doctor . His passion for running started off four years ago and thanks to Hyderabad Runners , founded by Rajesh Vetcha , Dr. Muralidhar could get an entry into the Boston Marathon in the doctors category . By all means , Boston edition , being one of the five majors of a marathon in the world has its unique identity and charm , says the doctor who in fact flew a distance of 1,000 km from Alabama to Boston along with his family members for the event . Well , in hindsight I can say the cramps which I suffered put me away from that incident as I had to get repeated treatment on the way even as my ultimate dream was to finish the marathon at any cost , says Dr. Muralidhar . Definitely , it is a huge disappointment eventually that I could not realise my dream . I always wanted to hold the Hyderabad Runners banner to represent this proud city at the finish line , says the former Hyderabad Public School student . As I said , all of us runners were about 800 m away from the finish line and were dazed when we ( his brother-in-law Sadasiva Rao Katta also took part ) first heard about the bomb blasts . And , I was more worried about my sister Shobha and my two nieces ( Meghana and Priya ) who were waiting at the finish line to receive me , he recalls . It was a great escape for them too as they had just gone into a nearby restaurant for a break when the bombings took place , says the doctor . It took three hours for me to get the message that everyone of my family members was safe . Till then , we were in a lost world honestly , says Dr. Muralidhar . The Sheraton Hotel where all the runners were diverted to represented a war-line zone . But , what stood out was the remarkable resilience and hospitality of everyone concerned , he remembers .
