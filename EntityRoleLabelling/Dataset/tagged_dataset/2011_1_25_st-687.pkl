S"Two car bombs on Monday struck Shia pilgrims in an Iraqi holy city , killing at least 18 people as pilgrims massed for religious rituals marking the end of a 40-day mourning period for the Islamic sect 's most beloved saint . The blasts in Karbala were the latest in nearly a week of attacks that have killed at least 159 people . The uptick in violence has shattered a lengthy period of calm and raised anew concerns about the readiness of Iraqi forces to take over their own security ahead of a full withdrawal by the U.S. military . The first attack occurred about 7 a.m. in a parking lot near busloads of pilgrims on the eastern outskirts of Karbala , 90 km south of Baghdad . Police and hospital officials said that six pilgrims were killed and 34 people wounded in that attack . A second bomb was discovered nearby and dismantled , police said . More than four hours later , a second car bomb struck pilgrims on the southern edge , killing at least 12 people , including 10 pilgrims and two soldiers , and wounding 21 . Monday 's attacks followed a triple suicide bombing last week along two highways leading to Karbala that killed 56 and wounded at least 180 most of them Shia pilgrims . AP OPEN"
