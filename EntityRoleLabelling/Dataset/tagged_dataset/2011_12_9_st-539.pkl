S"A sum of Rs . 70 lakh sanctioned by the State government towards payment of compensation to 20 Muslim youths , who were falsely booked and allegedly harassed by the city police in connection with Mecca Masjid bomb blast that occurred on May 18 , 2007 , will be disbursed immediately to them . The compensation allotted to these youths of the old city is described by the government as a measure to build confidence among the Muslims , particularly in the city , a Minorities Welfare Department official said . He said each of these 20 youths would get a little more than Rs . 3 lakh , out of the sanctioned amount . This was the first time that the government had come forward with such a benevolent gesture to allow the compensation . It 's a social mission , he said . OPEN"
