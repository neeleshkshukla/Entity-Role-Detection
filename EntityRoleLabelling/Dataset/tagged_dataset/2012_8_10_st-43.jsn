In its supplementary charge sheet filed at a special court at Panchkula , the NIA has named Kamal Chauhan , alias Bhai Saab , and Amit alias Ashwani Chauhan , and charged them with murder , conspiracy , and some other serious offences . In its charge sheet , the NIA has accused Chauhan and Amit , who is currently missing , of planting suitcase bombs in the Indo-Pak Samjhauta Express train that claimed 68 lives , mostly Pakistanis , on February 18 , 2007 . The NIA has said the duo , along with Lokesh Sharma and Samunder , alias Rajender Choudhary , who is also missing , had planted the bombs in the train near Panipat . The remaining five accused charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act are Naba Kumar Sarkar alias Swami Asimanand , Sunil Joshi ( now dead ) , Lokesh Sharma , Sandeep Dange , and Ramchandra Kalasangra alias Ramji . All the seven accused are allegedly linked to Hindu right-wing organisations . In its charge sheet , the NIA , which has been investigating the case since July 29 , 2010 , has said that Kamal Chauhan had visited Delhi from Indore to select the target for the blasts . They had initially decided on Delhis Jama Masjid area , but dropped the plan due to tight security in the communally sensitive locality . Later on , Samjhauta Express was selected as the target .
