Kode confirmed the death penalty of Ashrat Shafiq Ansari ( 34 ) , Mohammad Hanif Abdul Rahim Sayyed ( 46 ) and his wife Fahmida Sayyed ( 43 ) . But the court partially quashed the order of the lower court discharging two other accused , Hassan Batteriwala and Rizwan Ladduwala , on the basis of a report of the POTA review committee . They will have to face trial for the crimes registered against them under IPC . The two accused have been directed by the High Court to appear before the POTA court in four weeks . All the accused have been given eight weeks to file an appeal in the Supreme Court . The conviction order will be stayed till then . On August 6 , 2009 , the special POTA court convicted the three accused and sentenced them to death . Ladoowala and Batterywala were discharged from the case after the apex court upheld a POTA review committee report which stated that no case could be made out . OPEN",
