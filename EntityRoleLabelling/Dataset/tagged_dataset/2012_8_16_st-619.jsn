The blast , which tore a huge hole out of a petrol tanker near the Dama Rose hotel , wounded at least five people , a military source at the scene said , while Syria 's deputy foreign minister said UN staff were unscathed . `` The FSA operation targeted a military command office with explosives designed to go off at a meeting of army officers and members of the shabiha ( pro-government militia ) which decides on daily operations in Damascus , '' Maher Nuwaimi , head of the FSA coordination command in Syria , said . Damascus has been hit by several bomb blasts , including an attack last month at the national security headquarters that killed three of President Bashar al-Assad 's top security chiefs and was claimed by the FSA . State television showed images of charred vehicles and the fuel truck , its rear end blown off and still smouldering from the blast as firefighters doused the area and security forces set up a cordon.AFP OPEN",
