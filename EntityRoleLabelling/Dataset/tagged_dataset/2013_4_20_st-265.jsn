While initial reports said it was a pipe bomb , officials now say the device contained at least 3 kg ammonium nitrate . They suspect that it was planted in a container attached to the bike , most likely in the rear portion . Officials suspect the perpetrators to be professionals . Among the victims , a piece of shrapnel was removed from the student Leeshas leg and a pellet from the chest of KSRP constable Ganesh Rao . CCTV footage The city police say they had obtained crucial evidence from the CCTV footage , thought the quality of the footage was not up to the mark , and are trying to get a better view of possible suspects with the help of forensic analysts . A source said : We have questioned several persons , including witnesses , but have not detained anyone . Meanwhile , teams from the National Security Guard and the National Investigating Agency are reconstructing the motorbike with available pieces to ascertain where exactly the bomb was fitted . The patterns of other bomb blasts across the country are also being analysed . Teams of experts from the central and the city Forensic Science Labs are analysing the debris to ascertain the contents of the bomb .
