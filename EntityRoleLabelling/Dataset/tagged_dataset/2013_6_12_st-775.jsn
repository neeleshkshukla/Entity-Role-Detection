One of the blasts `` was caused by a suicide bomb attacker who blew himself up inside the police station '' , said the Observatory , revising its earlier reports . `` A second explosion took place just outside the police station , '' the group said , without elaborating on the nature of that blast . `` The number of casualties is expected to rise because several of the wounded are in critical condition , '' added the Observatory , which relies on a network of activists , doctors and lawyers for its reports . Areas of central Damascus have suffered frequent bomb attacks through the course of Syria 's 26-month war.AFP OPEN",
