The 14 -LCB- + t -RCB- -LCB- + h -RCB- Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate rejected the bail pleas of Devender Gupta and Lokesh Sharma who were arrested by the Rajasthan ATS in connection with Ajmer bomb blast case . The CBI later brought them to the city on a prisoner 's transit warrant in connection with Mecca Masjid blast case on June 17 and produced them in the court which remanded them to judicial custody . The court has observed that it 's a very sensitive case and religious feelings were involved in it . Investigations were not completed . Some more material objects have to be collected after apprehending the prime accused . Moreover , Unlawful activities prevention Act is invoked in this case to grant mandatory period of further 90 days for completing the investigation and filing charge-sheet .
