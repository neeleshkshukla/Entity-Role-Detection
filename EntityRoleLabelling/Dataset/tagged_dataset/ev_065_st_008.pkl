VMUMBAI : The Anti-Terrorist Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- arrested Raees Ahmed on Sunday for his complicity in the September 8 serial blasts in Malegaon that killed 31 people . He was produced before a special MCOCA court that remanded him to police custody till November 16 . ` Raees is a conspirator and a bomb planter , ' said a senior ATS official . He is the brother-in-law of Shabbir Ahmed Masiullah alias Shabbir Batterywala , the prime conspirator , and was earlier arrested for his role in a September 13 bomb hoax at Malegaon . Over 300 injured in four blasts that rocked the powerloom town on the occasion of Shab-e-barat . Raees is a resident of Malegaon and a suspected SIMI activist . This is the third arrest in connection with the Malegaon blasts . Meanwhile , Shabbir Masiullah , who was arrested on November 2 in connection with the Malegaon case will be taken to Bangalore on Monday morning for a narco analysis test and lie-detector test , police said . ` The accused in this case are not co-operating in the investigation , so we are conducting scientific tests on them , since it would help us to carry out a fair and meticulous probe , ' said an officer attached to the Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- on Sunday.Shabbir , who is said to be a trained Lashkar-e-Taiba operative , is believed to have plotted the Malegaon blast to trigger communal tension and riots in the textile township , the police said . Malegaon police also registered a case over a fake bomb found on September 12 . They have claimed that the mud used in the dummy bomb was similar to the soil found near Shabbir 's battery unit . Investigators have also found traces of RDX in a battery manufacturing unit owned by Shabbir in Malegaon . The police suspect the bombs were manufactured at Shabbir 's battery unit .
