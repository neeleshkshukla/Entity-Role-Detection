The suspect 's house , which has been cordoned off for gathering forensic evidence , is located close to the building where the explosion took place , killing two alleged members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh . On Wednesday , the NIA had searched the residence and shop belonging to the accused , Hashem Moulla , in Bardhaman , lifted swabs of explosive traces from a vehicle belonging to the owner of the house where the blast took place and seized a laptop . The agency also summoned another suspect from Birbhum and seized a computer from a shop there . According to agency sources , the Jamaat extremists involved in the case were part of a larger conspiracy to `` destabilise the incumbent Sheikh Hasina-led Bangladesh government . Some of the arrested persons have turned out to be from Bangladesh . `` One of those killed in the October 2 blast -LSB- Subhan -RSB- was also a Bangladeshi national ,  said an officer . OPEN",
