Following the recovery of the bodies , the death toll in violence in Kokrajhar , Chirang , Bongaingaon and Dhubri districts has gone up to 60 . About 4.33 lakh displaced people are taking shelter in relief camps in the districts . Inspector-General of Police ( Law and Order ) L.R. Bisnoi told The Hindu that the bodies of two inmates of the Kawakati relief camp near Borlao village in Chirang district , who went home looking for their cattle , were found with cut marks in a village . In another incident , two persons from Bongaigaon , who went to Kokrajhar via Chirang in an autorickshaw on Saturday , were hacked to death . Their bodies were recovered from the Champabati river in Kokrajhar district on Sunday morning . After the news of their death spread , a mob blocked National Highway 31 at Bortol in Chirang district and threw stones at a bus of the Bodoland Transport Service , prompting the police and paramilitary forces to fire in the air to disperse them . Chirang Deputy Commissioner Puru Gupta said the driver , conductor and a passenger sustained minor injuries . Indefinite curfew was imposed again in the district . Additional Director-General of Police ( Special Branch ) Khagen Sarma said a low intensity blast occurred at Goreswar in Baksa district when a farmer , along with two others , was trying to operate a transistor which he found on a paddy field . The three sustained injuries . Police did not rule out the possibility of someone discarding the transistor with some circuit inside , perhaps due to the movement of security personnel in the area .
