S"The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) today arrested one more person in connection with West Bengal 's Burdwan blast for allegedly indoctrinating youth for training by showing ` Jihadi ' videos related to Gujarat and Assam violence . Zia-ul-Haque , a resident of Nadia in West Bengal , was arrested from Masjid Talha in Khagragarh of Burdwan district where he was hiding and was traced by NIA with the help of central security agencies . According to NIA spokesperson , Haque was a close associate of absconding accused persons Rezaul Karim and Yusuf Sheikh alias Moulana Yusuf . During investigation , it was found that the accused was part of a Jihadi training module where he was a key motivator for trainees in the Jihadi ideology . The investigation into the role of Zia-ul-Haque showed that he was also closely associated with top Jamaat-ul - Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) commanders including absconding commander Sajid for whose arrest a cash reward of Rs . 10 lakh has been announced by the NIA . On October 2 , the blast had taken place inside a house at Khagragarh in which one person , Shakil Ahmed , died on the spot and another person Sovan Mandal died in hospital . Both were suspected to have terror links . Meanwhile in Guwahati , Sujana Begam , wife of Burdwan blast case accused Sahanur Alom , was arrested , police said today . The Guwahati city police had information about Sujana 's movements and tracked her to the ISBT in the Gorchuk area where they arrested her last night , Superintendent of Police ( Operations ) City Sudhakar Singh said . Sujana , wanted in the Special Operation Unit ( SOU ) case number 1/14 , was handed over to the SOU for further action , Singh said . She was with her minor son when police nabbed her , he added . Sahanur Alom is absconding and the NIA has recently declared a Rs . 5 lakh reward for anyone giving information leading to his arrest . OPEN"
