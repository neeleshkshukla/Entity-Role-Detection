S'At least a dozen people were killed and 20 injured in a blast that ripped through a hotel in Dera Allah Yar in Balochistan on Sunday morning . This is the biggest terrorist attack across the country since the month of Ramadan began nearly a fortnight ago . None claims responsibility No organisation had claimed responsibility for the bomb blast till late in the evening though officials suspect the hand of Baloch separatists . The bomb was planted inside the hotel and the explosion brought the building down . The police feared that the toll could go up as many people were said to be buried under the debris . Preliminary investigations have revealed that the bomb was set off with a timer device and local media reported that the police had picked up two people who left the premises just before the explosion . Balochistan has been restive since Independence but the past couple of years have been particularly violent . In another incident , rockets were fired at a military camp in North Waziristan ; killing three soldiers just after the national flag was hoisted as part of the Independence Day celebrations . OPEN'
