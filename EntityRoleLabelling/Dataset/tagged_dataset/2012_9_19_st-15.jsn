    "content": "The former Gujarat Bajrang Dal president , Babu Bajrangi , recently sentenced to life imprisonment till death in the 2002 Naroda-Patiya massacre case , was assaulted in the Sabarmati jail dispensary here on Tuesday by some accused in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial bomb blast cases . Jail sources said the incident took place when Mr. Bajrangi was brought to the dispensary for a medical check-up . Four persons , , all said to be members of the Indian Mujahideen and housed in the same jail , were in the dispensary when Mr. Bajrangi was brought there . They pounced on him , but he escaped with minor injuries . The jail security staff quickly removed him from the scene . Additional Director-General of Police ( Jails ) P.C. Thakur , however , disagreed there was any physical violence in the jail and claimed that there were only serious verbal altercations between the blasts accused , who were still facing trial , and Mr. Bajrangi , before he was whisked away . We are aware of the security threats to Mr. Bajrangi and the others accused of serious crimes , and we make full security arrangements every time before any of them is brought out of the barracks , he claimed . The jail authorities have ordered an investigation . OPEN",
