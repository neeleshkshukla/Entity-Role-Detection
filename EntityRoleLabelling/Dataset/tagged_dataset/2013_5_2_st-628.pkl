S"An election candidate escaped unharmed on Wednesday in a suicide bombing in southern Pakistan which left two people wounded , police said , after the latest in a wave of attacks to hit the campaign . The attack came in southern Shikarpur district of Sindh province , some 400 kilometres northeast of Karachi , when Mohammad Ibrahim Jatoi , a candidate for the May 11 poll , was on the campaign trail . `` A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up near the car of Mr Jatoi , but he was unharmed , '' local police station chief Zaheer Mahesar told AFP . Only the bomber died in the blast . Jatoi , from the small National People 's Party , was returning from campaigning when the bomber targeted him at a toll collection point , Mahesar said , adding that two passers-by were wounded . `` We have found arms and head of the suicide bomber , '' he said . District police chief Ghulam Azfar confirmed the suicide attack and said that up to six kilos of explosives were used in the device . Violence has spiked in the nuclear-armed country ahead of national elections on May 11 , with at least 61 people killed in attacks on politicians and political parties since April 11 , according to an AFP tally.AFP OPEN"
