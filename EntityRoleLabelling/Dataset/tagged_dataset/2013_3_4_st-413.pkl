S'Delay in the release of ex-gratia amount to the victims of Dilsukhnagar twin bomb blasts is forcing patients to take readmissions at Care Hospital , Nampally . On Saturday and Sunday , close to four patients discharged by the hospital administration , took readmission because they had not received the ex-gratia amount from the revenue authorities . According to the set rules , the government is providing Rs . 50,000 to blast victims who had stayed in the hospitals for less than four days and Rs . 1 lakh for more than five days . At Care Hospitals , Nampally , of the 32 patients admitted , 17 patients are still admitted to the hospital . Sources said that close to four victims and their families , had to be readmitted because they did not get the ex-gratia amount during their discharge . Usually , the revenue department officials issue ex-gratia cheques and take pictures of the patients while they are being released from the hospitals . Similar instances of delay , however , were not reported from Yashoda Hospital , Malakpet . On Sunday , two patients Madhusudhan and Krishnakanth were discharged from Yashoda Hospital , Malakpet , after they received cheques worth Rs . 1 lakh each from the authorities . In all , of the 14 blast victims , so far six patients have been discharged from Yashoda Hospital , Malakpet . The condition of Ravi Kumar continues to remain critical while another victim , Pandu Ranga Reddy , who was in a critical condition , is now responding to treatment , the Yashoda hospital doctors pointed out . The condition of Ravi Kumar continues to remain critical while Pandu Ranga Reddy is responding to treatment OPEN'
