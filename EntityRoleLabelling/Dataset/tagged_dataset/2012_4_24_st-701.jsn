    "content": "The Delhi Police have received a report from the Central Bureau of Investigation 's Central Forensic Science Laboratory stating that trinitrotoluene ( TNT ) had been used in the improvised magnetic device to trigger the blast in the Israeli Embassy 's car here over two months ago . The detailed report prepared by explosive experts following examination of the samples lifted from the blast site close to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's 7 Race Course Road residence said TNT had been used as an explosive for configuring the device . It also reportedly confirmed that a magnetic strip was used to attach the device to the car in which Tal Yehoshua Koren , an Embassy official and wife of Israel 's defence attach in New Delhi , was going to pick up her children from school on February 13 . TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives by the military and construction companies as it is stable compared to other explosives , reducing the risk of detonation by accident . Earlier the Delhi Police had described the device used in the attempted assassination of the Israeli diplomat as a sticky bomb , used for the first time in the country . The police last month claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of senior journalist Syed Mohammed Ahmad Kazmi , alleging that he was in touch with one of the Iranian suspects involved in the attack . The three Iranian nationals who visited the country to allegedly conduct reconnaissance and target the Israeli Embassy car were then identified as Houshang Afshar Irani , Seyed Ali Mahdian and Mohammad Reza Abolghasemi . The police also drew a link between the car blast and the explosions in Bangkok on February 14 , stating that Irani was in touch with the suspected head of the module operating in Thailand . The suspect was intercepted in Malaysia after the arrest of his two alleged accomplices in Bangkok . OPEN",
