    "content": ". . Three blasts rocked Mumbai 's crowded Zaveri Bazar , Opera House and Dadar Kabootarkhana areas on Wednesday evening , killing 10 and injuringat least 100people . . . . . Mumbai Police sources say the Indian Mujahideen is suspected to be behind the attack . In Delhi , Home Ministry sources too say that the hand of the IM working closely with the Lashkar-e-Tayiba is suspected.The first explosion took place at south Mumbai 's Zaveri Bazaar , near the famous Mumbadevi temple , in which scores were injured , said Mumbai Police spokesperson Nisar Tamboli . . . . . The injured in this blast have been rushed to G T Hospital in Kalbadevi area . . . . . The bustling market also has a number of jewellery shops . . . . . Akshay Doshi , a commuter , told rediff.com , ' I was at the traffic signal opposite Zaveri Bazar . The blast was like nothing I have heard before . I saw many injured being carried away . ' . . . . Senior police officers including Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik , Additional Commissioner Naval Bajaj and Joint Commissioner Rajneesh Seth were present at the blast site . . . . . Also present were members of the Mumbai Anti-Terrorist Squad and a forensic team . . . . . . . The second explosion was reported in a car in central Mumbai 's Dadar area . . . . . The vehicle parked near the Dadar Hanuman Mandir bus stop was a private vehicle . The blast at Dadar , according to ACP Madhukar Sankhe , has taken place inside the meter box on the bus stop and the car was parked near it . The number of the grey car is MH-43 A 9384 . The entire bus stop has been reportedly blown up . . . . . ` We are verifying the nature of explosions . At this moment I can not say anything more than this , ' Tamboli said . . . . . A third blast was reported from Opera House in Charni Road . The blast occurred outside a building named City Chamber . Ten people have died in the blast , claim reports . . . . . The critically injured have been taken to Harkishan Das Hospital at Girgaum . . . . . Jayesh Labdi , a local diamond merchant , who claimed to have taken several inured to the hospital , said the blast occurred at peak hour . ` Most of the injured were hawkers , ' he said . . . . . The blast in Opera House has left jewellers in the area petrified . . . . . The limbs and legs of victims still are still scattered at blast site . This being an area where diamond traders do business , so there is a possibility of diamonds being scattered in the blast . Police have cordoned off the entire area.Ankit Jhaveri told rediff.com , ` At around 7.05 pm we were shaken up to hear the blasts . I have never heard such sound before . ' . . . . Vikram Balerao , a resident of Ambedvadi , which is situated barely 30 metres from the blast site at Opera House , was one of the few volunteers who took the injured to the nearest Saifee hospital . He said he saw many people without limbs and legs . . . . . Since there were no stretchers available immediately , they used tarpaulin sheets to ferry the injured to the hospital . Teams of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad and the National Investigative Agency have rushed to the spot . . . . . . . .",
