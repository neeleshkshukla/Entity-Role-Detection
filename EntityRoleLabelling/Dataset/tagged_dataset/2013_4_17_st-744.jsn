The twin explosions 13 seconds apart came more than a decade after nearly 3,000 people were killed in suicide airliner strikes on New York , Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11 , 2001 . Act of terror ? President Barack Obama went on national television to warn against `` jumping to conclusions '' but a senior White House official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said such an attack was `` clearly an act of terror . '' Special agent Rick DesLauriers , who heads the Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) Boston bureau , told reporters : `` It is a criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation . '' Security was stepped up in major cities across the United States amid fears of a repeat of the September 11 attacks . Obama said those behind the blasts will `` feel the full weight of justice . '' At the blast scene , a horrific chorus of high-pitched wailing and screaming rang out as bewildered runners and spectators fled the carnage and debris . An eight-year-old boy was reportedly among the dead . The Boston Globe identified him as Martin Richard , whose father William was running in the race . His mother and a sister were gravely injured while a second sister was unharmed . More than 100 people were wounded , Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick said , without giving an exact figure . The Globe said more than 140 were hurt . OPEN",
