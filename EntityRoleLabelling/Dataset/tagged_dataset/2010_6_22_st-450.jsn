He will be in CBI custody till June 30 . The magistrate issued the orders after the CBI filed a petition in the court on Friday seeking custody of Gupta to elicit more information about the blast . Another petition to conduct test identification parade of Lokesh Sarma , the other person arrested in the case , was also filed . Gupta , along with his associate Sarma , were produced before the court by the CBI on Thursday . The court sent them to two weeks judicial remand following which they were lodged in Chanchalguda jail . They were earlier arrested for alleged involvement in the bomb blast at Ajmer and lodged in Ajmer Central Prison . They were brought from Ajmer prison on a prisoner 's transit warrant . The accused are members of the Abhinav Bharat , a Hindu fundamentalist organisation . CBI officials will submit court documents to authorities of Chanchalguda prison on Tuesday and take Gupta into their custody , said CBI Senior Public Prosecutor T. Venkata Ramana .
