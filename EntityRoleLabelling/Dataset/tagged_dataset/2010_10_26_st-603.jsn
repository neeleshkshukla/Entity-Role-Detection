    "content": "Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday refuted allegations of political motive as well as his government 's involvement in naming RSS functionary Indresh Kumar in the charge-sheet filed by the State 's Anti-Terror Squad ( ATS ) on the 2007 bomb blast in Ajmer dargah . This is not Gujarat , he said . Rajasthan has no such tradition . The police administration functions independently and they did a good job in the investigation of the incident . The Government did not influence the investigation in any manner and therefore the question of political motive behind naming anyone does not arise , he said as journalists quizzed him over the role of RSS in the Ajmer dargah blast at a press conference here . It is not in the tradition of Rajasthan to do such things . Rajasthan is not like Gujarat where even DIG level officer goes to jail At least in our time this will not happen , he said . A debate is presently raging over the 806-page charge-sheet in the dargah bomb blast case , filed by the ATS in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Ajmer last Friday . Asked why Indresh Kumar was not included as an accused in the charge-sheet , Mr. Gehlot said it was for the investigators to decide . RSS wants to say that his name appeared in the charge sheet for political reasons . Now you are asking why he has not been charge-sheeted . We have no answers as we are not involved in these processes . OPEN",
