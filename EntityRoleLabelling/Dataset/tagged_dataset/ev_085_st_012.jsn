    "content": "VARANASI : Has the Indian Mujahideen added Semtex explosive to its armoury ? It appears so , going by the analysis of the samples collected from the December 7 blast site at the Dasaswamedh Ghat . Top police and Anti-Terror Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- officials , on condition of anonymity , said : ` The use of this explosive is quite certain as initial tests with the Israeli kit have shown the use of multiple chemicals in the bomb . ' Semtex is a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate -LRB- PETN -RRB- . It is used in commercial blasting , demolition and in certain military applications . The explosive is notoriously popular with global terrorists as it is extremely difficult to detect . But if Semtex was used in the December 7 blast , which mechanism was adopted by the terrorists to detonate the bomb ? The police as well as the investigating agencies are still tight-lipped as the final report of the Forensic Science Institute -LRB- Gujarat -RRB- team led by M S Dahiya is yet to come . It is expected Dahiya 's report would not only reveal the name of the explosive , but also the mechanism used to detonate the bomb . ` If the test report confirms Semtex , it would be an alarming signal for the security agencies who are ill-equipped to detect this sophisticated explosive , ' said a senior police officer . The report is expected anytime in a day or two .",
