Abdul Kalam , has condoled the loss of lives in a series of bomb blasts and militant attacks at Dimapur in Nagaland and in Assam yesterday . . . In separate condolence messages to the Assam Chief Minister , Tarun Gogoi , and the Nagaland Chief Minister , Neiphiu Rio , Mr. Kalam said that the acts of violence ` are to be condemned and are reprehensible acts of people who do not value innocent human lives , even those of women and children . '' . . ' I fervently hope that permanent peace will return to the State soon . I am sure the State Governments have made all arrangements to treat the injured and provide succour to the families of those who have lost their loved ones , ' he said . . . Strategy sought . . The Communist Party of India , the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- and the Bharatiya Janata Party have condemned the blasts and called upon the Centre , the State Governments and the authorities to work out a strategy to counter such incidents . . . In a statement here today , the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- Polit Bureau said that the Central Government should immediately convene meetings with the State Governments and other authorities in the North-East to work out a strategy . . . Expressing shock and condemning the Nagaland blasts , the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- said that the ` premeditated manner ' in which the bombs were placed at the railway station and the market showed the ` aim of the attacks is to disrupt peaceful atmosphere in the State . ' . . On the attacks in Assam , they said , ` All attempts to foment ethnic conflicts through such violent attacks have no support from the common people . The growing trend of extremist groups resorting to indiscriminate violence in Assam must be countered by firm action and popular mobilisation to isolate them . ' . . ` Talk to State Governments ' . . The CPI urged the Home Minister , Shivraj Patil , now visiting Assam and Nagaland , to talk to the State Governments and other authorities and evolve a strategy to counter the insurgency and prevent further deterioration of the situation . ` It is also necessary to take fresh political initiatives to restore normality and tranquillity in the entire North-East region , ' the party said . . . Condemning the incidents , the BJP Parliamentary Party spokesman , Vijay Kumar Malhotra , said : ` It appears that the Government does not seem to be very sensitive towards the internal security issues . Beginning with Manipur and now Nagaland and Assam , the whole of North-East seems to be burning . ' . . PTI and UNI report from Guwahati : . . The BJP in Assam today said that yesterday was a ` black day ' for the State and alleged that the Congress Government in the State had lost the moral right to continue . ` The day was a black day for the State when many innocent lives were lost and the Government just remained a mute spectator , ' a spokesman for the party 's State unit , Dhruba Baishya , said . He alleged that the State Government was ` directionless ' and had no policies to deal with militancy . . . Assam bandh . . The All-Bodo Students Union -LRB- ABSU -RRB- has called for a 12-hour Assam bandh tomorrow to protest against the killing of innocent people.Several other organisations have also condemned the killings and extended support to tomorrow 's bandh .",
