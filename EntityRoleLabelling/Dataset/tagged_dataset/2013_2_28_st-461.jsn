The 23-year-old youth from Kalapather went to Dilsukhnagar in search of work when he got injured in the bomb blast on February 21 . Later he was admitted to the Yashoda hospital at Malakpet for treatment . Mr. Wasey was twice unlucky as in 2007 also he suffered severe injuries in Mecca masjid bomb blast and had to undergo four surgeries . He was a student then . Name cleared by police His presence at both the bomb blast sites drew attention of the media and the police . However , his name was cleared by the police . Speaking to media after his , Mr. Wasey thanked Allah for saving him for the second time . The wounds still pain but I feel I have improved in the last one week , Wasey said . He also thanked the people for their support and prayers . A cheque of Rs .50,000 as ex gratia by the government was handed over to him . Doctors have advised Wasey to rest for a few days to recover fully . The mere coincidence of this 23-year-olds presence at the sites of bomb blasts has put him in the media glare as a suspect OPEN",
