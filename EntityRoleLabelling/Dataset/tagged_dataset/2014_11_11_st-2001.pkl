S"In yet another major breakthrough , the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) today arrested Amjad Sheikh , alleged to be a key member of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) terror group , in connection with the Burdwan blast case . Sheikh , alias Kajal , a resident of Birbhum district of West Bengal , is alleged to be the main suspect who used to procure material , meant for making improvised explosive devices , from open market . The NIA said 30-year-old Sheikh was instrumental in procuring chemicals and providing these to other co-conspirators for making Improvised Explosive Devices . This is the second major breakthrough after the arrest of Bangladeshi national Sajid , suspected mastermind of the October 2 blast , by West Bengal police near Kolkata airport on Saturday . Sajid is alleged to be the Chief Commander of JMB . According to official sources , Sheikh was working with a Kolkata-based medical firm which deals with manufacturing of various sterilisation products . He used his employment with the firm for procuring many restricted acids including ` Picric acid ' used for triggering an explosive device . The NIA had announced a cash reward of Rs . five lakh on information leading to Sheikh 's arrest but later enhanced it to Rs . 10 lakh . Soon after the blasts , the NIA had raided his Kolkata house and recovered receipts and vouchers related to purchase of chemicals which were used in making the IEDs . Investigation found that Sheikh was part of the top brass of JMB in India and after October 2 blast , he took shelter in New Delhi on October 8 and from there moved to Basti in Uttar Pradesh where he was provided shelter for a few days by a policeman . Ultimately , he went back to West Bengal from where he was arrested today , NIA said . Sheikh , who is the sixth person arrested in the case , is alleged to be closely associated with top JMB commanders who were running jihadi training modules in two madrassas of West Bengal . OPEN"
