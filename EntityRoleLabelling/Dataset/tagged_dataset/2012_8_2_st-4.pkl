S'Four low-intensity blasts within a one-km range on the busy Junglee Maharaj Road were witnessed in Pune on Wednesday . While one person was confirmed to be injured in the incident , Pune Police Commissioner Gulabrao Pol has ruled out the terror angle and stated that it was a case of mischief . The explosions were set off by pencil cell detonators placed in a plastic bag , a dustbin and in cycles at two locations , police said . Speaking to reporters at the blast site , Mr. Pol said , The situation is under control . There is no need to panic . The Pune ATS and teams from the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) from Mumbai and Delhi will investigate the matter further , he said . First blast at 7.30 p.m. . The first explosion occurred around 7.30 p.m. near Balgandharva Rang Mandir , an auditorium on Junglee Maharaj Road . Dayanand Patil , who was injured in the blast , was carrying a cake box kept in a plastic bag , police said . He was admitted to Sassoon Hospital , where the police recorded the evidence . While unconfirmed reports stated that Mr. Patil was a member of social activist Anna Hazares India Against Corruption movement , IAC coordinator Preeti Sharma Menon denied it . According to the police , the second explosion occurred in a dustbin outside the popular fast food joint McDonalds . Soon after , the third and fourth blasts went off at Dena Bank and Garware Chowk , in the same vicinity , with the explosive material planted in cycles . Another bomb was defused by the police within the next one hour . The number of injured might have been higher , but have not been reported as they were minor injuries . The explosions occurred on the day when newly appointed Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde was scheduled to be on a visit to the city . It was cancelled earlier in the day . OPEN'
