    "content": "Kolkata : In a major breakthrough , Sajid aka Sheikh Rehmatullah , the alleged mastermind of West Bengal 's Burdwan terror module and a key member of a banned Bangladeshi terror outfit , was arrested by the state police on Saturday afternoon near the Kolkata airport.A pan card and a voter ID card have been recovered from him.Sajid was arrested by the Anti-Terror Squad of the Bidhannagar Police which had tracked a courier who was to deliver money to Sajid on Saturday afternoon on Jessore Road near the Kolkata airport . Sajid is the first suspected Bangladeshi national to be arrested in the case . He is believed to be a central committee member of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangaldesh or JMB which is banned in that country . He is expected to be handed over to the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- shortly.The NIA had announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for any information leading to Sajid 's arrest . According to the NIA , Sajid was living at Lalgola in Murshidabad district near a madrasa that NIA has now sealed.With this arrest , the exact operations of the terror module is likely to emerge.On October 2 , a bomb had exploded in a house at Khagragarh in Bengal 's Burdwan district in which two persons , Shakil Ahmed and Sovan Mandal , were killed . Initially assumed to be a gas cylinder blast or explosion of crude bombs , investigations revealed Shakil Ahmed and Sovan Mandal were using fairly sophisticated improvised explosive devices or IEDs.Interrogation of two women arrested from the blast site revealed that a network of terror was spread across several districts in Bengal.In a house close to the blast site suspected to have been occupied by terrorists , the NIA recovered 39 IEDs eight days after the state police searched and sealed it . .",
