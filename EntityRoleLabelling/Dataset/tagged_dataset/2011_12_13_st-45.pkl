S"The Bombay High Court on Monday postponed the confirmation of death sentence to three accused in the 2003 Mumbai blasts case . One of the accused is a woman . The verdict will be pronounced either next week or in the first week of January , after the vacation , Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said in his chamber on Monday . The court cited technical reasons for the postponement of the verdict . Since Justice Kode has been transferred to Nagpur , the Division Bench is finding it difficult to sit together to complete the judgment . The judge told us that the verdict will be out next week or in the first week of January , Sushan Kunjuraman , counsel for Ashrat Ansari , told The Hindu . On August 25 , 2003 , blasts at the Gateway of India and Zaveri bazaar killed 54 persons and injured 244 . The Mumbai Police arrested the trio Ashrat Ansari ( 32 ) , his aide Hanif Sayed Anees ( 46 ) and wife Fehmida Sayed ( 43 ) along with others . They were charged under various sections of POTA ( Prevention of Terrorism Act ) and the IPC ( Indian Penal Code ) . The special POTA court awarded death sentence to the trio in 2009 . They were sentenced under three Sections : 120B of the IPC for hatching a criminal conspiracy to cause bomb blasts , 120B read with Section 302 ( punishment for murder ) of the IPC , and 120B read with 3 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the POTA , stipulating the punishment for a terror act . The prosecution then moved the Bombay High Court for confirmation of the death sentences , while the accused filed an appeal against the special POTA court 's verdict . According to the prosecution the conspiracy was hatched in Dubai and certain Pakistani nationals had supported the attack . It said the attack was carried out to avenge the death of members of the minority community post-Godhra . The defence argued that there were no direct eye-witnesses to the planting of the bombs . I argued that all the eye-witnesses were fabricated . Ashrat is accused of planting the Zaveri bazaar bomb but the driver of the taxi in which the bomb was planted , died . So there are no direct eye-witnesses . I pleaded that he should either be given the benefit of doubt or should be released due to lack of evidence , Mr. Kunjuraman said . The Division Bench had last month reserved the judgment after the final arguments of the defence and the prosecution . It had said it would declare the verdict on December 12 . Technical reasons cited for postponement ' Three were given death sentence in 2009 OPEN"
