    "content": "Agartala , October 1 ( PTI ) Terrorists struck Agartala for the first time as two persons were killed and 76 injured in a string of five blasts at crowded markets and bus stands in a span of approximately five minutes this evening . . . The low-intensity blasts took place at Agartala 's main shopping area Maharaja Ganju Bazar , Gobind Ballah Pant market , busy Radhanagar bus stand , Agartala Motorstand and Abhay Nagar localities . . . The first blast occured at Radhanagar bus stand at around 7.30 pm and it was followed by the explosions in the other places in quick succession , police sources said . . . An unidentified man was killed in the blast at G B Market while another person succumbed to injuries . . . The condition of five of the injured was stated to be critical . . . Panic gripped the entire capital of Agartala and people ran helter and skelter soon after the blasts . . . Bomb squads and forensic experts examined the blast sites . . . Police sources , quoting eyewitnesses , said two persons riding a motorcycle were seen moving suspiciously at Radhanagar bus stand and the blast took place there two to three minutes after they left the area . . . Police sources suspect the involvement of Bangladesh-based terror group Hizbul Mujaheedin Islamia ( HuJI ) which has of late used Tripura as a transit route as the state shares a pourous 856-km border with the neighbouring country . . . Three suspected HuJI members were arrested in Agartala in the last two months . . . Central intelligence agencies had on September 25 warned the northeastern states of an impending terror attack and BSF officials here confirmed having received the input . . . .",
