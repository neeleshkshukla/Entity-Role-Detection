    "content": "Nearly 20 people were killed in a suicide blast at a security check post in the Bajaur tribal agency on Friday morning . According to the Associated Press , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) claimed responsibility for the blast triggered by a teenager . Police said the suicide bomber detonated his bomb-strapped vest as he approached a check post in Khar , the main town of Bajaur . Several of the dead and many among the 40 injured were security personnel , particularly of the Bajaur Levies force . Bajaur the smallest of the seven Federally Administered Tribal Agencies adjoins the Kunar province of Afghanistan where the TTP is said to have safe havens . The agency has also seen prolonged military operations to flush out terrorists . In mid-March , federal Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed that the TTP had split after it removed Maulvi Faqir Muhammad from the post of deputy commander . This had given rise to speculations of the TTP which is held responsible for some of the deadliest attacks inside the country getting weakened . Maulvi Faqir fell out with the TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud for warming up to the federal government 's offer for talks with terrorists as part of its give-peace-a-chance ' policy . OPEN",
