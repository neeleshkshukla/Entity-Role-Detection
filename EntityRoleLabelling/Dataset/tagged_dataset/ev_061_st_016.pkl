VNew Delhi Search on for militants involved in Delhi blasts . . Staff Reporter . . NEW DELHI : Five days after the arrest of the alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- conduit , Tariq Ahmed Dar , the Delhi police were still busy trying to piece together the entire sequence of events leading to the October 29 serial blasts in the Capital . A massive search has been launched to trace the militants who , according to Tariq , had planted the bombs . . . Senior police officers on Tuesday remained tight-lipped over the developments in the cases , but it is learnt that they were interrogating Tariq and some other persons reportedly picked up on suspicion of their involvement in the blasts . . . A Special Cell team had earlier visited Jammu and Kashmir to conduct raids on suspected hideouts of the militants identified by Tariq , including the LeT commander , Abu Huzefa . . . The police team also went to Tariq 's residence in search of evidence establishing his suspected links with the terrorists . They were also trying to trace the satellite phone through which he was alleged to be in regular contact with his Pakistan-based handlers , including the Pakistani LeT commander for operation in the Kashmir Valley , Abu Al Kama . The police are also probing the monetary transactions through Tariq 's HDFC account in Srinagar . Investigations so far have revealed that money in huge amounts was transferred to his account from time to time , from a Middle-East country -LRB- Saudi Arabia -RRB- . . . The intelligence agencies are trying to identify the source of the money-transfer .
