S"The police on Tuesday arrested a man from the Bagnan rural hospital in West Bengal 's Howrah district in connection with last week 's blast in the Delhi High Court complex . According to the police , his injuries resemble those caused by a bomb blast . The arrest of Afzal Taiyyab was made following certain inputs . His statements were incoherent and a suo motu case has been registered against him . We suspect he has had a role in the blast or in sending a terror mail , said a senior Howrah district police official . The National Investigation Agency has already traced the second terror mail , in which the Indian Mujahideen reportedly claimed responsibility for the Delhi blast and threatened further explosions , to a mobile phone whose SIM card was procured from the city . Meanwhile , the Special Task Force of the city police traced a hoax terror mail circulating in the city since late on Monday to a group of school students in the Topsia area . Some schoolchildren tried to play prank , circulating the mail which threatened explosions in city shopping malls . Since the offenders were juvenile , they were warned and their parents asked to give an undertaking to the police , said STF chief Rajiv Kumar . Security was stepped up , nonetheless , at all shopping malls and in market areas . We are requesting people not to panic . All senior police officials are regularly supervising the security arrangements in the crowded shopping areas . The police have already chalked out crowd control measures for Durga Puja . We will continue carrying out regular checks and cross-checks , said Commissioner of Police R.K. Pachnanda . OPEN"
