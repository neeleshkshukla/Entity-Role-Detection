    "content": "Andhra Pradesh Forensic lab to compile data of North-East blasts . . By Our Staff Reporter . . HYDERABAD , OCT. 18 . The Central Forensic Science Laboratory , Ramanthapur , the first and the only FSL in the country to get accreditation of the National Board of Laboratories , is to compile data of the recent blasts in Assam and Nagaland . This would enable it to identify those who may be involved in such nefarious activities . . . Compilation of the data is to be taken up as part of a major research project , ` Creation of national bomb data centre , ' under a ten-year plan . The centre will be on the lines of that evolved by Israel , according to Chandranath Bhattacharyya , director . . . Data collected . . The CFSL has already collected data from various explosions that occurred in some States , comprising the nature and mode of explosion , extent of damage , casualties , parts of bomb container , fragments and initiation devices . The data , when compiled and analysed , would help crime investigation agencies link the crime with the groups who carry out that particular kind of operation . . . Sampling kits . . Dr. Bhattacharyya visited the recent bomb blasts sites at Guwahati -LRB- Assam -RRB- and Dimapur -LRB- Nagaland -RRB- with senior officials of the lab and collected samples which are to be examined at CFSL . As part of its programmes to create awareness about forensic science , the laboratory is proposing to distribute gun shot residue -LRB- GSR -RRB- sampling kits to all crime investigating agencies , including those in the North-East . The kits help in the collection of GSR particles from the hands of suspected shooters . . . CFSL will conduct a national-level two-day workshop on application of SEM-EDXA on GSR analysis from November 24 , where experts in GSR from the UK will provide training to ballistic staff from all over the country .",
