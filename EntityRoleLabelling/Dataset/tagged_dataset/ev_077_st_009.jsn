Amir Raza Khan , learnt to be a member of terror outfit HuJI is a resident of Kolkata , while Riyaz Bhatkal is alleged to be the founder member of Indian Mujahideen -LRB- IM -RRB- . Bhatkal brothers had connived with SIMI leaders to hatch the conspiracy of serial blasts in the city and trained local people , the chargesheet submitted last week by the Crime Branch said , adding , IM was a new form of SIMI . SIMI members Safdar Nagori , Hafez Hussain , Sibli Abdul Karim , Kamruddin Nagori , Amil Parvez and Mufti Abu Basher planned the attack and asked Abdus Subhan alias Tauqeer and Qayamuddin Kapadia for executing the blasts . SIMI members organised terror training camps in Waghamon in Kerala and Halol near Vadodara , it said . Qayamuddin and Tauqeer then held a meeting with their local contacts in the city for arrangements of logistics and support to carry out the conspiracy . The local contacts were those who were associated with SIMI before it was banned in 2001 by the Central Government . Some of them have already been arrested by the crime branch while some are still absconding , the 2000-page chargesheet stated . Gujarat police had earlier claimed that Abu Basher was the mastermind behind the terror attacks in the city .",
