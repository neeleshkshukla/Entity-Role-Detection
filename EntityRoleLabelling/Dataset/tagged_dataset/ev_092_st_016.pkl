VRaipur : Congress leaders on Monday denied reports that the route of the ill-fated ` Parivartan Yatra ` , which came under Naxal attack on Saturday in south Bastar region , had been changed at the last moment . . . The convoy of Congress leaders was attacked at Jiram Valley in Darbha region when it was returning from Sukma to Jagdalpur . Twenty-seven people including Chhattisgarh Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel and veteran leader Mahendra Karma were killed and 37 others including former union minster VC Shukla were injured . . . Reacting to reports in local media about last-moment route change , former Chief Minister and Congress veteran Ajit Jogi said , ` Rally ` s route was not changed . MLA TS Singhdeo was in-charge of the route schedule and he had submitted the same route chart thrice for security approval . . . ` Convoy was proceeding according to its pre-decided schedule . This was a sheer security lapse , ' Jogi said . . . Dantewada MLA Kwawasi Lakhma , who was with Patel during the attack , too said there was no change of route . ` According to the plan we were moving to Keshlur in Darbha region via Tongpal . I was with Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh in the SUV . We were talking about the security arrangements . I told him that I had written to police for providing security on the Darbha route but there was no security , ' he added .
