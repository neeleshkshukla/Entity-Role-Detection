Narayana , Deputy Superintendent of Police , denied having any knowledge of the arrival of any investigation teams in Bhatkal.A section of the media had flashed the news of arrival of the ATS in Bhatkal town . The town has gained importance because Riyaz Bhatkal and his brother Yasin Bhatkal , who were the founders of Indian Mujahiddin , hail from Bhatkal . The Indian Mujahindin was one of the organisations suspected to be behind the recent bomb blast in Mumbai . Mr. Narayan said the normal procedure was that the police from outside the State contacted their local counter parts for help in such situations . Since the issue involved national security , the local police always helped teams that came from outside the State . The local police had been gathering information related to the terror attack . He denied that any member of ATS had arrived in Bhatkal . OPEN",
