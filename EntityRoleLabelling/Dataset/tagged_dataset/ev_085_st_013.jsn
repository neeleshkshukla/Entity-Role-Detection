Though the nature of explosives is yet to be ascertained , the sources said there were no burn or shrapnel injuries . Meanwhile , of the 37 injured in the blasts , one is said to be in a critical condition . Forensic experts are examining the blast scene to find clues about the exact nature of the explosives used .
