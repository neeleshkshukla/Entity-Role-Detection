VPolice have picked up 25 persons for questioning in connection with the bomb blasts in the Godhra and Lunawada bus stations both in the tribal-dominated Panchamahals district of central Gujarat in the last two days . . . A senior police official of the district , however , did not see any ` definite pattern ' in the bomb explosions and believed these to be acts of local anti-social elements trying to create panic . The bombs were crude ones not requiring expert handling . The official also disagreed that the blasts could have any links with the Godhra train carnage of February 27 as the time gap between the two was large . . . While the bomb that exploded at the Godhra bus terminus on Tuesday last was planted in a bus , at Lunawada , the explosion was on the platform and most of the injured were those who queued up in front of the drinking water pub . . . In the wake of the explosions , the State Transport Corporation is strengthening security in and around bus stations , particularly in the Panchamahals district . The crew have also been issued strict instructions not to stop the buses at any point other than specified platforms and maintain vigil on the movement of suspicious passengers .
