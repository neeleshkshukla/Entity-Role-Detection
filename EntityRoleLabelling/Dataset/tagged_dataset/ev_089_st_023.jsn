New Delhi : Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj slammed Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday and termed his statement on the Hyderabad blasts as routine . . . Routine statements are not enough , said Swaraj . Cornering the government in view of reports that the Centre had prior intelligence on the possibility of a terror strike , she said , The Centre ` s role doesn ` t end after warning states about terror threats . If the Centre had information , then why did it not do anything to prevent the blasts ? . . She said that the time is not to play blame games but to stand united . . . Earlier in the day , she said , `` We can be united only when our thoughts in fighting terror are similar . The Home Minister himself is saying that he gave the information . But , if there was information , the blame doubles . If there was information , what was the Centre , the state doing ? `` . . `` The nation needs to be united ; the political parties need to get united . The moment that happens , we will be capable of fighting terror , ' Swaraj said in the Lok Sabha . . . Asserting that terrorists have no religion , Sushma said : ` Terrorists only follow the code of terrorism . We need to be united against terrorism . ' . . She further said that this is not the moment to lay blame , but to work together to combat terrorism . . . Both houses of the house witnessed pandemonium today with the Opposition demanding answers from the government on the issue .",
