The stone quarry is said to belong to Jagmohan Reddy and Jagadish of Kurgodu village in Bellary taluk . The reason for the blast can not be ascertained immediately . Experts from the bomb squad would be pressed into service , Chandragupta , Superintendent of Police , who visited the spot , told The Hindu . Though the quarry has been functioning with a valid licence , the stock of gelatin sticks might have been stored illegally , sources said . The intensity of the blast was indicative of how big a stock may have been kept in the makeshift storeroom . According to sources , the accident occurred when the gelatin sticks , said to have been brought from Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh , was being dumped in the storeroom . The police identified the victims as Mahadeva , Doddabasava and Karibasappa , who died instantaneously , and Nagaraj , who succumbed to his injuries at the VIMS Hospital later in the evening .
