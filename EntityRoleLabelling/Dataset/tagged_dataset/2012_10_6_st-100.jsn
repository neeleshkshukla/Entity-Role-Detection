    "content": "Detection of many cases is delayed owing to shortage of police personnel , inadequate facilities and equipment , increase in number of cases and poor cooperation of people . Sometimes , little carelessness and lack of preparedness among police personnel who inspect the crime spot also affect the investigation process and in a worst case scenario , the police are clueless . The police were in such a condition when they investigated the bomb blast case at a TASMAC shop in Theni recently . Normally , the police had to cordon off the entire area to protect it and stop people from entering the crime spot and to prevent them from destroying evidences . But the police did not do them in the case of the TASMAC incident . Before the arrival of police , local people thronged the area and moved from one corner to another in a fit of tension and anxiety . When the police reached the spot , they could not control the crowd and had a tough time in collecting evidences from the blast site . The area was not cordoned off . The investigation officials as well as members of Bomb Detection and Disposal squads could not get accurate details from the crime spot as the public reportedly destroyed minute evidences inadvertently . Plastic tapes , metal barricades , dividers and other materials worth several lakhs of rupees were given to every police station in Theni district to cordon off crime spot . Many police stations never use them , say police sources . The investigation team might have missed many minute evidences owing to movement of people . Many were in an inebriated state as well . Since the blast site was not cordoned off , people moved about freely , writes K. Raju OPEN",
