It occurred in a garbage dump near a nullah and the victims were rag-pickers . Unofficial reports said the blast , in a basti ' inhabited by rag-pickers , claimed five lives four children and a woman . It is suspected that a crude bomb was placed in the dump and the device went off around 3.30 p.m. when the children playing in the area handled it . A team of the Anti-Terrorist Squad ( ATS ) and forensic experts have rushed to Allahabad . Uttar Pradesh Inspector-General ( Law and Order ) B. P. Singh told journalists that it appeared to be a powerful blast considering the damage caused . One of the deceased was identified . The injured include two girls and two women in the age group 11 - 40 . Mr. Singh denied that crude bombs hurled by some anti-social elements caused the explosion . He , however , admitted that Allahabad , particularly the old city area , was notorious for manufacture of crude bombs . When it was pointed out that a similar blast occurred in Allahabad last year and the victims were three children , Mr. Singh said crude bomb blasts were common there . OPEN",
