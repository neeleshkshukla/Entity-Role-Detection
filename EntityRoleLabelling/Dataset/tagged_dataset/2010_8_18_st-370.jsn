The State Committee of the PDP will observe black day on Thursday . The Bharatiya Janata Party has asked the public to reject the hartal call . The PDP 's move to garner sympathy of a section of the Muslim community and the Home Ministry 's attempt to delay the arrest should be condemned , its national council member Madikkai Kammaran said in a statement .
