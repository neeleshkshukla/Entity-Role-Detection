VOn the eve of Foreign Secretary-level talks in Thimphu , Pakistan on Saturday came out with a provocative statement saying that India 's handling of the Samjhauta Express train bombing case showed that it lacked `` courage to unearth culpability of Hindu extremists '' . It appears that the Pakistanis are not too keen to see any improvement in ties that might lead to resumption of the talks that were stalled following the Mumbai carnage . Or this might be to check India from making too many demands on the progress or lack of it in the Mumbai blast trial that is taking place in Pakistan . But what are the facts on the ground ? . . . . Around midnight on February 18 , 2007 , bombs were set off on the Delhi-Lahore Samjhauta Express , a twice-a-week service . This happened a day before Mr. Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was to arrive in India for talks . The incident occurred near Panipat in Haryana , 80 km north of Delhi . 68 persons were killed , 42 of them Pakistani civilians , besides some Indian citizens , and army jawans guarding the train . . . . . The case was under investigation with the Haryana police who could not make any headway after their probe led to a tailor in Indore who had prepared the cover of the suitcase in which the bombs were planted . After over three years , the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency in the middle of 2010 by the Central government . At that time , there were reports that the Hindu right-wing groups that were involved in the Malegaon and Ajmer blasts were also involved in the Samjhauta Express blast . The Americans had in the meanwhile , in early 2009 , identified a Pakistani , Asif Kasmani , of the Lashkar-e-Taiba , as involved in the Samjhauta Express blast , and moved the UN to declare him as an international terrorist . Americans generally do not make such claims easily . Did they have some clue , or evidence that the Indian investigators missed ? The investigators had therefore to move carefully and look at unimpeachable evidence to come to any conclusion about the actual perpetrators . . . . . But did India , or the Indian police , lack any courage in unearthing the culpability of extreme Hindu outfits in such terrorist acts ? The Anti-Terrorist Squad of Maharashtra led the way in unearthing the complicity of Hindu right wing groups in the Malegaon blast of September 2008 , and filed charge sheets against 11 accused , including a serving Army colonel and a Sadhvi , in January 2009 . Their investigations continued even after that ; and the Maharashtra ATS have made more arrests in the case . The harshest sections of law , including the dreaded Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act , were applied against the accused in this case . The Anti-Terrorist Squad of Rajasthan filed a charge sheet against a Hindu right wing group for the Ajmer blasts in October 2010 . Does this show any lack of courage in dealing under law with the extreme right wing groups ? . . . . The Samjhauta Express case has also been broken open , this time by the National Investigation Agency , with the arrest of a Hindu God man , and a recording of his confession by a magistrate . The NIA has proclaimed substantial rewards for information that have led to the arrest of three absconding accused . These investigations have compelled the Madhya Pradesh police , where the right wing BJP is in power , to go after the killers of one Sunil Joshi , a Hindu right wing activist , who had allegedly played an active role in all the three blasts and was allegedly killed by his own colleagues as he knew too much . This investigation had been closed as untraced , but was revived in the wake of the arrests made in the blast cases . The National Investigation Agency , the Central Bureau of Investigation and the ATS Units form Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been working closely to break open the blast cases . The investigators have to carefully collect all available evidence to bring the charges successfully against the perpetrators of these crimes . The investigation can not be based solely on confessions , but will also have to look for independent evidence to corroborate material particulars . It is too early to share the result of the Samjhauta Express case with Pakistan , and the Indian Home Minister is on record that as soon as this becomes possible , India will be happy to share the details with Pakistan . . . . . On the other hand , the trial in the 26/11 case is moving at snails pace in Pakistan . Hafiz Saeed , the main architect of the Mumbai attacks , is moving freely , and a couple of days back , was threatening war with India if we fail to vacate Kashmir . Our request for voice samples of some of the accused for purpose of comparison in the 26/11 case is still pending . So who is scared of unearthing the culpability of right wing terrorists , India or Pakistan ? .
