S"C. Jaishankar Sri Lankan fishermen allege pair trawling RAMANATHAPURAM : Four fishermen had a narrow escape when a mechanised boat in Rameswaram was sunk , allegedly by a group of Sri Lankan fishermen . According to a complaint lodged by the fishermen , who managed to escape , the attack was carried out near Kachchatheevu on Monday . The boat -LSB- TN-10 MFB 263 -RSB- owned by Stalin of Rameswaram sank within moments of a bomb blast triggered by the fishermen reportedly belonging to Delft Island near Kachchatheevu . The fishermen were identified as Stephen ( 43 ) , Mehallan ( 25 ) , Alex ( 25 ) and Prabu ( 26 ) of Rameswaram . T. Ilamvazhuthi , Assistant Director of Fisheries , Rameswaram , told The Hindu that a preliminary enquiry had revealed that a group of Sri Lankan fishermen , reportedly hailing from Delft Island , carried out the attack opposing the practice of pair trawl net fishing , which was banned . It was stated that fishermen from Delft Island and the nearby islands had earlier warned the Rameswaram fishermen not to follow pair trawling , which might damage the nets cast by them and affect marine wealth in the bottom of the ocean . There was a report that the boat that was attacked was among a pair of boats , which had cast pair trawl nets . The fishermen could escape as the attackers blasted the boat after asking them to jump and board the other boat . The fishermen said their fishing gear and the day 's catch were also sunk . Mr. Ilamvazhuthi said the incident was the first of its kind after a gap of nearly three years . Search order demanded The fishermen had demanded a search order to locate the boat . However , a decision would be taken only after collecting all information related to the incident . Tough action would be taken against those following pair trawl practice , he warned . OPEN"
