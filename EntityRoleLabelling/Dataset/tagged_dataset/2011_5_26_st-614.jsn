    "content": "The low-intensity explosion in a car outside the Delhi High Court here on Wednesday throws a new challenge to the Delhi Police even as two similar cases of explosion in the recent past remain unresolved . The explosion in a Ford Figo car on Wednesday afternoon brought back memories of a similar explosion in a Maruti 800 car near Jama Masjid last year and a blast in a market in Mehrauli in 2008 . Both the cases are yet to be worked out . Though it is yet to be established whether or not these incidents are related , but the bombs in all three cases were of a crude nature . The explosion in the Maruti 800 in September last came a few hours after two armed men on a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at a group of tourists who were about to get into their bus . The car went up in flames following an explosion a little later , but no one was injured . A pressure cooker and a crude circuit were found in the car . The police said that it was the handiwork of some disgruntled group and locals could be involved , but there is no breakthrough in the case so far . Though an e-mail purportedly sent by Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the attack , the police suspected that the organisation could have hired some locals to carry out the attack as its execution was amateurish . About 50-60 locals with criminal antecedents were interrogated by the district police and the case was later transferred to the Special Cell for investigation . The blast in the Mehrauli Sarai Market in September 2008 that claimed three lives also met a similar fate . During investigation , the police found striking similarities between the explosion in Mehrauli and a series of low-intensity blasts in different parts of South Delhi earlier that involved Bangladeshis . Nearly 50 Bangladeshi nationals were questioned , but they could not be linked to the blast and the case remains unresolved . OPEN",
