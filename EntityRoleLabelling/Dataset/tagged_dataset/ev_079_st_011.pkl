VSincerity and honesty became the death warrant for the child who lost his life in the blast that shook the flower market in Mehrauli of South Delhi on Saturday . . . Santosh Kumar -LRB- 13 -RRB- , who fell victim to the low intensity bomb , was only trying to return the ` packet ' of the two motorcycle-borne youth . . . Little did Kumar , hailing from Bihar , know that he was trying to return the bomb , which the duo had deliberately dropped . . . The last words heard by eyewitnesses and his relations were Kumar saying , ` bhai saab , aapka packet gir gaya hai -LRB- brother , your packet has fallen -RRB- . ' . . `` Everything happened so suddenly . Thick smoke came out instantly and there was a bang . My nephew was in blood , '' recounts his maternal uncle Fantoosh , a snacks vendor selling omelets and boiled eggs . . . Santosh was sent by his maternal uncle to fetch a crate of eggs when the incident happened . . . His grandmother , Rekha , was wailing for Kumar who was declared brought dead by the hospital authorities . . . Santosh 's father works as a labourer in a godown in Delhi while his brother is a rickshaw puller . . . His parents belong to Lakhi Sarai district in Bihar and had migrated to Delhi in 1980s . They were living in Islam colony near to the blast site . . . Migrant labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh live in this colony .
