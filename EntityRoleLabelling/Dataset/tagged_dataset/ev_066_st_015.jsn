    "content": "Praveen Swami . . Suitcase bombs intended to kill by fire , not explosion ; Rs . 10 lakh for next of kin of each of the deceased . . PANIPAT : At least 67 people were killed and 50 injured when two firebombs went off on the New Delhi-Wagah Samjhauta Express just before midnight on Sunday . Most of the dead , including three children , are Pakistani citizens : the first civilians of that country to have died in a terrorist strike on Indian soil . . . The attack comes a day ahead of Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri 's three-day official visit to Delhi . . . Investigators believe the perpetrators of the terror strike intended that the bombing be mistaken for an arson attack - a deception they hoped would deflect suspicion away from them . . . Forensic tests on three unexploded suitcase-bombs found on the train will take at least 48 hours to complete , but a senior intelligence official told The Hindu that investigators have been able to determine that the devices were cleverly designed to start a fire . ` They were incendiary devices , ' he said , ` rather than explosive devices . ' . . ` Whoever carried out this attack , ' the official said , ` hoped that it would be interpreted as arson . Many in Pakistan would have blamed Hindu fundamentalists for the attack . India would have suspected terrorists , but few in Pakistan would have believed its claims . Unfortunately for the perpetrators , and fortunately for us , three devices failed to work . ' . . Forensic findings . . Bottles filled with kerosene and then packed with cotton-wool were recovered from the three unexploded devices . Digital travel alarm clocks linked to a circuit-controlled detonator were used to control the timing of the ignition . A severed wire has been established , in one case , as the cause of the firebomb 's failure to ignite . . . The absence of an explosion meant the driver of the Samjhauta Express did not realise there was a fire until he was alerted by station staff at Deewana , near Panipat . . . Passengers said the train kept moving for over fifteen minutes after the fire broke out , delaying their escape from the two burning compartments . . . Railway Minister Lalu Prasad who visited the site and Safdarjung hospital in Delhi , admitted that poor security facilitated the strike . However , he noted that station authorities do not possess baggage-screening equipment . . . An official inquiry into the bombings will look into measures to improve security , but Railway Police officials say that screening of all passenger baggage may not be possible . . . Mr. Prasad announced a compensation of Rs . 10 lakh for the next of the kin of each of the deceased and Rs . 50,000 for the injured . Investigators plan to question survivors to see if any of them saw the suitcases being planted on the train . Since doors and vestibules are closed on the Samjhauta Express , it is almost certain that the bombs were planted in New Delhi , most likely by a perpetrator who did not board the train . . . Technically , the ill-fated train is the Delhi-Attari Special -LRB- 4001 UP -RRB- , though it is commonly known as the Samjhauta Express . . . All passengers on the Special train alight at Attari , on the Indian side of the border , from where they catch another train to travel three kilometres to Wagah in Pakistan . Investigators say the fact that most witnesses are Pakistani nationals will pose an unusual challenge . . . ` Many of the survivors we need to speak to will soon be in Pakistan , ' a senior Ministry of Home Affairs official told The Hindu . . . ` This investigation will be a real test of India-Pakistan counter-terrorism cooperation , ' he said . . . Helpline numbers . . The Railways has set up telephone helplines to provide information on the Samjhauta Express tragedy . . . They are : New Delhi Railway Station 011-23341074 and 23342954 ; Headquarter -LRB- New Delhi -RRB- 011-23389319 , 23389853 and 23385106 ; Hazrat Nizamuddin 011-24355954 ; Ambala 1072 -LRB- local helpline number -RRB- , 0171-2610329 and 2611072 ; Amritsar 0183-2223171 and 2564485 ; Ludhiana 0161-2760006 ; Jalandhar 0181-2223504 ; at the site 0180-3297823 and 6450342 .",
