S'A pair of bombs blasted through security checkpoints ringing the Iraqi holy city of Karbala Thursday and killed at least 50 people , many of whom were Shia pilgrims headed to observe yearly religious rituals . Authorities estimated as many as 175 people were injured in the afternoon blasts , at least one of which appeared to be caused by a car bomb . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks . But they bore the hallmark of Al-Qaeda and other Sunni-dominated extremist groups that frequently target Shia pilgrimages in hopes of re-igniting sectarian violence that brought Iraq to the brink of civil war just a few years ago . Ali Khamas , a pilgrim from the Shia neighbourhood of Sadr City in Baghdad , said he saw a car speeding toward one of the checkpoints , its driver refusing to stop despite warnings screamed by Iraqi soldiers . He sped up and blew up his car near the checkpoint , said Mr. Khamas . After the explosion , people started to run in all directions , while wounded people on the ground were screaming for help . I saw several dead bodies on the ground . Still , Mr. Khamas said , the pilgrims continued to head to Karbala . It will not deter us from continuing our march to the holy shrine ... even if the explosions increase . The bombings were the latest in a three-day barrage of attacks across Iraq that have killed more than 100 people since Tuesday . AP OPEN'
