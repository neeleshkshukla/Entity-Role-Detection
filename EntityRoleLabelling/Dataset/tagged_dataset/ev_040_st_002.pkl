VGUWAHATI : An improvised explosive device was used to trigger the blast that led to the derailment of the Guwahati-Puri Express in Kamrup district in Assam that left 100 passengers injured , officials said on Monday . . . Railway PRO Nripendra Bhattacharya said the explosion led to the engine and eight coaches jumping the rails at around 8:30 last evening at Dhatkuchi between Rangia and Ghagrapar in the district . . . Four of the coaches toppled over and fell into a three feet water-filled ditch following the explosion , he said . . . A large crater beside the tracks and a huge length of fuse wire leading to a jungle were found by the Bomb Disposal Squad after the derailment . . . A senior police officer said it appeared to be the handiwork of the Ranjan Daimary-led National Democratic Front of Bodoland anti-talk faction , active in the area . . . The officer said at least 100 passengers were injured who were admitted to the Guwahati Medical College and Hospital . . . Of the injured , 41 were in a serious condition , hospital sources said . . . Railway officials are supervising restoration operations at the spot with 300 labourers at work , the officer said . . .
