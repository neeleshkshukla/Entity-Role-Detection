    "content": "Bombings mainly targeting Shiite-majority areas of Baghdad killed at least 23 people on Thursday , officials said , a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki vowed to press a campaign against militants . Security forces have carried out major operations against Iraqi militants in recent weeks , but the action has so far failed to stem the worst violence to hit the country in five years . The six car bombs and a roadside bomb struck six different areas of the capital on Thursday morning - five of them Shiite-majority and a sixth mixed - also wounding more than 70 people . In the single deadliest attack , a car bomb exploded at a bus station in the Kadhimiyah area of north Baghdad , killing seven people and wounding 24 . Another car bomb exploded in Baladiyat near an office of Al-Ahad television , which is affiliated with Asaib Ahl al-Haq , a Shiite militant group that split from powerful Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr 's Mahdi Army . No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks , but Sunni militants including those linked to Al-Qaeda frequently target members of Iraq 's Shiite Muslim majority , whom they consider apostates . The violence came a day after attacks including a blast at a cafe north of the capital killed 17 people.AFP OPEN",
