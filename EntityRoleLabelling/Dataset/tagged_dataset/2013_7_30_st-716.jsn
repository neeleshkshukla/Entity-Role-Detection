    "content": "A wave of over a dozen car bombings hit central and southern Iraq during morning rush hour on Monday , officials said , killing at least 51 people in the latest coordinated attack by insurgents determined to undermine the government . The blasts , which wounded scores more , are part of a months-long surge of attacks that is reviving fears of a return to the widespread sectarian bloodshed that pushed the country to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . Suicide attacks , car bombings and other violence have killed more than 3,000 people since April , including more than 500 since the start of July , according to an Associated Press count . The group , known as the Islamic State of Iraq , frequently sets off such coordinated blasts in an effort to break Iraqis confidence in the Shia-led government . Officials said 12 parked car bombs hit markets and parking lots in predominantly Shia neighbourhoods of Baghdad within one hour the deadliest being in the of Sadr City . AP OPEN",
