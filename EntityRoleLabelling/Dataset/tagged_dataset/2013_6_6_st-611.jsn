The explosive was placed in a small steel tiffin box in a garbage dump . The children Deepak , Shankar and Karan Manjhi aged between eight and 10 years , tried to open it when the bomb went off between 8.15 a.m. and 8.20 a.m. , police said . Deepak and Shankar were rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition with head and limb injuries . Karan was admitted to the Sadar hospital in Nawada . Superintendent of Police Manavjit Singh said the children were out of danger and were making good progress . There did not seem to be any terror link so far . Apart from the bomb that went off , two other tiffin box bombs were defused by a bomb squad . Contents of the explosives were sent for forensic examination . Preliminary reports indicated that sulphur , potassium nitrate , diesel and nut and bolts were used in making the bomb . It is an improvised explosive , but low in intensity , Mr. Singh told The Hindu . The children belong to Dalit families . They are ragpickers who eke out a living by selling metal scrap . They are our only eyewitnesses . We still have to record their statements , he said . OPEN",
