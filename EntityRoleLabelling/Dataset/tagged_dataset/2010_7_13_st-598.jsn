    "content": "An Al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group claimed responsibility on Monday for twin bombings in Uganda that killed 74 people watching the World Cup final on TV , saying the militants would carry out attacks against our enemy wherever they are . The explosions ripped through two bars packed with soccer fans watching the final moments of the World Cup final on television in an Ethiopian-themed restaurant and at a gathering in a Kampala rugby club on Sunday . Ugandan government spokesman Fred Opolot said on Monday there were indications that two suicide bombers took part in the attacks . The blasts came two days after a commander with the Somali group , Al-Shabab , called for militants to attack sites in Uganda and Burundi , two nations that contribute troops to the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia . Al-Shabab , whose ranks are swelled by militant veterans of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq , has long threatened to attack outside of Somalia 's borders , but the bombings late on Sunday are the first time the group has done so . We will carry out attacks against our enemy wherever they are , said Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage , a militant spokesman in Mogadishu . No one will deter us from performing our Islamic duty . Ugandan officials had said earlier that they suspected the Somali group was involved . One of the targets was an Ethiopian restaurant a nation despised by the Al-Shabab militants . The attacks on two soft targets filled with civilians raised concerns about the capabilities and motives of Al-Shabab , which the U.S. State Department has declared a terrorist organisation . Indians killed A California-based aid group , meanwhile , said one of its American workers was among the dead . Police said Ethiopian , Indian and Congolese nationals were also among those killed and wounded , said police . AP OPEN",
