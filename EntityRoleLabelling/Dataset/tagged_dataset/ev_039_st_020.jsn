In a statement e-mailed to the media on Monday , ULFA chief Arabinda Rajkhowa said , We condemn Sundays blast in which innocent indigenous Assamese people were killed and such an act can be carried out only by enemies of Assam . The blast is part of a greater conspiracy and it was definitely carried out by forces who want to derail the peace process initiated by the ULFA . . . We believe that killing of indigenous Assamese people can not ensure the development of the state and we warn that such inhuman acts are stopped immediately , Rajkhowa said further . He appealed to the people to foil such attempts by forces , who are not interested in the well-being of the people and development of Assam . . . The denial comes even one person , suspected to be a ULFA militant , was picked up in connection with the blasts . . . Kumud Thakuria , arrested from Nikashi village in Baska district adjoining Nalbari district and sharing international boundary with Bhutan , was later shifted to Nalbari for interrogation . . . .",
