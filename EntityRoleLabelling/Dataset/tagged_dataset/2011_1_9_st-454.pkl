S'Unidentified miscreants threw county-made bombs at a house at Thiruvallur Valiyad in the limits of Vadakara police station in the district on Friday night . No casualty has been reported . The bombs hit the compound wall of a house belonging to N.P. Kunhammed . The wall developed fissures due to the impact of the blast , the police said . The area had earlier witnessed clashes between activists of the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML ) and the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( CPI-M ) . A case has been registered in connection with the incident . The son of Kunhammed was an accused in the case of attack on a reading home recently , the police said . An all-party meeting comprising leaders of various political parties had called for restoring peace at Thiruvallur in the wake of increasing violent incidents in the region .
