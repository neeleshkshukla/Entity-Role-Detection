A day after it was reported that the United States Ambassador , David Mulford , had written to the Assam Chief Minister , Tarun Gogoi , offering the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to probe the recent bomb blasts , External Affairs Ministry sources said today that it was ` not usual ' for an ambassador to write to a chief minister . . . Asked if the Ministry had taken up the issue with the U.S. Embassy , the sources said that it had been conveyed to the American side that all communications should be routed through the Ministry . . . The Ministry spokesman refused to go beyond what was stated in a brief statement made on Tuesday . . . Asked at a briefing whether it was ` normal ' for an Ambassador to write directly to a chief minister , he said the Ministry 's position was contained in the statement issued late last night . . . Was this a protocol violation on the part of the U.S. Ambassador , he was asked . The spokesman said the entire issue was considered and a statement was issued on Tuesday night . It said the offer would be considered ` in terms of the existing guidelines ' of the Government of India . However , there is no amplification of what the guidelines are . . . ` Let them handle Iraq first ' . . Asked to comment , sources in the security establishment were blunt . ` Let them -LSB- the Americans -RSB- handle Iraq first and then turn their attention to the North-East . ' . . ` The Americans have lost all sense of diplomatic niceties . They have , probably , got used to doing things this way with our western neighbour -LSB- Pakistan -RSB- , ' the sources said . . . If the Americans really wanted to help they could have sent one of their officers to meet one of ` our ' Joint Secretaries . Though the stated position was that the American offer would be considered ` in terms of the existing ' guidelines of the Government of India , the sources said New Delhi 's response was that of ` thanks , but no thanks .
