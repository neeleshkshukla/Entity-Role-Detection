VNew Delhi , Oct. 29 : Bombs today ripped through three New Delhi markets packed with families shopping for Diwali and Id , killing over 50 people and wounding many more . . . Burnt bodies , bloodstains , glass shards and smoking debris littered the spots as rescuers frantically pulled out the dead and injured . Thousands of survivors milled around in shock , trying to find out what had happened to missing relatives . . . The government immediately sounded a national alert and the crisis management group went into a huddle . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cut short his visit to Calcutta and dashed back to the capital . . . Singh called it an act of terrorism . This kind of cynical attack on the people of India is just not acceptable , said a spokesman for the Prime Minister . He ( Singh ) is very distressed . India will never be defeated by terrorism . . . In a rapid reaction , Pakistan showed no hesitation in terming the blasts an act of terrorism . Pakistan strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in New Delhi . The attack in a crowded market place is a criminal act of terrorism , a foreign office statement said . . . There was no immediate finger-pointing for the explosions , which come at a time when India and Pakistan are discussing lowering border barriers to bolster earthquake relief efforts . But home minister Shivraj Patil said : They were not accidental . . . Terrorism is a menace that we all have to face and fight unitedly , Sonia Gandhi said after visiting the injured in Safdarjung hospital . . . The first explosion , in Paharganjs 6 Tooti Chowk at 5.30 pm , wrecked shops and killed at least eight people on the spot . Besides being a major shopping area flanking Connaught Place , Paharganj is near the New Delhi railway station and has many hotels for budget tourists . . . There was a huge sound , said Sunita , who lives near the market . I saw many people lying on the ground . I saw a childs arm cut off and somebody elses brain smashed out . It was very bad . Very bad . . . The toll in the second blast at Sarojini Nagars crowded Babu Market is expected to be high because the improvised explosive device went off near a cooking gas cylinder used by a snack vendor . . . Shopkeepers cleared their carts and used them as makeshift stretchers to rush victims to hospitals . AIIMS , Safdarjung , Lady Hardinge and Ram Manohar Lohia struggled to cope with the rush . . . At Govindpuri in south Delhi , an alert bus conductor averted a huge toll . Noticing someone had left their bag behind in the bus , he hurled it outside , where it exploded , killing three persons . . . The government called for calm . A red alert was sounded in Delhi , its borders were sealed and all markets were closed down . Mumbai police put the financial capital , target of several blasts in the past 12 years , on high alert . . . Delhi police , who said RDX had been used in all the blasts , saw parallels with the 1997 serial explosions in the capital , which were masterminded by Abdul Karim Tunda , a Lashkar-e-Toiba bomb expert . . . A Delhi court was expected to sentence a suspected Lashkar militant today in the Red Fort attack case , but put it off till Monday . Earlier this year , the capital had witnessed twin cinema blasts . . . Ten people were detained from New Delhi railway station and a few bus terminals . A hotel was also raided . . . Washington had recently warned of possible attacks on US interests in India . . . We saw bodies terribly charred , limbs missing . It was a horrible sight , a terrible sight , one British tourist said . Dont let the terrorists win .
