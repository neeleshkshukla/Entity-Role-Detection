The source said the agency had obtained the account numbers of the persons whose identities were yet to be ascertained . The agency would probe possible links of these accounts to find whether money was used for terror funding . Early November , the ED had registered a case of money laundering against Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) and several of its recruits in connection with the blast . The case was registered by the agency based on the FIR filed by the National Investigation Agency and the information provided by it . The NIA is probing the terror angle of the blast which took place in October two . The source said that accounts of the accused persons named in the FIR were also being probed to ascertain the money trail . Asked whether the agency had got any clue so far on money raised by Ponzi firms being used for terror funding , the source said no evidence was there as of now . Soon after the NIA took charge of the probe , a team from the terror funding cell of the agency met ED officials to share information . OPEN",
