S"At least 14 people were killed when twin explosions caused by suicide bomb attackers struck near a police station in Damascus on Tuesday , state television said , updating its earlier toll . `` The number of casualties after a twin suicide attack in Marjeh square has risen to 14 dead and 31 injured , '' said the broadcaster . `` The two suicide explosions took place near a police station , '' it added.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the blasts , but put the toll higher at 15 . `` The number of people killed after two explosions in Marjeh square in Damascus has risen to 15 , '' said the Britain-based monitoring group . One of the blasts `` was caused by a suicide bomb attacker who blew himself up inside the police station '' , said the Observatory , revising its earlier reports . `` A second explosion took place just outside the police station , '' the group said , without elaborating on the nature of that blast . `` The number of casualties is expected to rise because several of the wounded are in critical condition , '' added the Observatory , which relies on a network of activists , doctors and lawyers for its reports . Areas of central Damascus have suffered frequent bomb attacks through the course of Syria 's 26-month war.AFP OPEN"
