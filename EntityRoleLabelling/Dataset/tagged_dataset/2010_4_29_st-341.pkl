S'Staff Reporter Anantapur : Country made bombs hidden in the attic of a kitchen exploded reducing the concrete house to rubble at Koukuntla village in Uravakonda mandal of Anantapur on Wednesday morning . No casualties were reported as there was none in the house then . The house belongs to one Vasanthamani . Her husband , who died a couple of years ago , was reportedly involved in faction feuds and the bombs may have been hidden by him then . The walls of the rear portion of the house where others were living suffered cracks due to the impact of the blast . Paddy stored in the house was also destroyed completely . According to Guntakal DSP Victor efforts were on to ascertain the cause for the explosion . He said Vasanthamani feigned ignorance about the bombs . The Uravakonda police are investigating . OPEN'
