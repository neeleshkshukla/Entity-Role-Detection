S": A writ petition has been filed in the Madras High Court Bench here seeking 10 days of emergency leave for a life convict in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case in order to attend the circumcision function of his brother 's children at Melapalayam in Tirunelveli district . According to the petitioner , S. Gowthul Aalam ( 45 ) of Melapalayam , his elder brother Syed Mohamed Buhari alias TADA ' Buhari was convicted by a Sessions Court in connection with the bomb blast case in 2007 and lodged in the Coimbatore central prison . His appeal was rejected by the High Court and a further appeal made to the Supreme Court was still pending . In the meantime , he was also implicated in connection with a bomb blast in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) office but that ended up in acquittal . Filing the writ petition through his counsel S.M.A. Jinnah , the petitioner also said that his was a joint family of two brothers and two sisters headed by their father Segu Pillai Sheik Mathar who passed away recently . After his demise , the family took every decision on the advice of the convict as he was the eldest . Our elder brother is leading us in the right path towards a decent and happy life and we have lots of respect , love and affection for him . His presence in the family functions would give happiness to our entire family and we treat him as the head of our family next to our father . Performing circumcision is the duty of every Muslim . The circumcision of my three sons is the first family celebration after my father 's death and it has been scheduled on May 27 as per my brother 's advice , the petitioner said and sought leave for the convict between May 25 and June 3 .
