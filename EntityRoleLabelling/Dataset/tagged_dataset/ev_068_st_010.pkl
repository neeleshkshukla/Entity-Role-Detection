VLucknow , May 23 : Vowing to come down heavily on disruptive elements in the wake of the Gorakhpur serial bomb blasts , Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati today blamed the Samajwadi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party for hatching conspiracy to '' unsettle '' her government . . . '' SP and BJP being in a spot after losing the recent assembly elections in the state are resorting to spreading communal tension to destabilise my newly elected government , '' she told reporters . . . These parties had nothing in their hands and they were indulging in petty tactics to vent their frustration , she said , adding that they were feeling jittery as the Lok Sabha polls were nearing and SP and BJP had already lost ground . . . '' My government has taken the incident very seriously and would ensure that the guilty are booked and such incidents are not repeated during my regime , '' Ms Mayawati said . . . Meanwhile , the Principal Secretary ( Home ) K Chandramauli , the state Director General of Police ( DGP ) G P Sharma , Additional Director General ( ADG ) Shailja Kanat Mishra and ADG ( Law and Order ) Brijlal had been airdashed to Gorakhpur in a special plane to gauge the situation . . .
