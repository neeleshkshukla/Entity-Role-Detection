Acting on a tip-off , a special team apprehended Sivanesan and Maheswaran alias Gopi , both Sri Lankan nationals , here . Agency sources said the two were part of a gang that conspired to trigger bomb blasts in Sri Lanka . They carried out trial blasts at a remote location in Cuddalore districts in December 2012 . The Q Branch had registered a case and arrested four persons then . Sivanesan and Gopi whose names figured in the case remained elusive . The suspects told investigators that they stayed in Tiruchi before moving to Chennai . They were agitated over Sinhalese people occupying Tamil-dominated areas in Sri Lanka and hence conspired to cause explosions there . The accused persons were produced in a city court and remanded in judicial custody , a police official said . OPEN",
