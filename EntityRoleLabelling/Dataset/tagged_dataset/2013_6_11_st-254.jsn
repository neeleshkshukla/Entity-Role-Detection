The police said two country bombs exploded in the forest area on the outskirts of Kooththenkuzhi in the early hours of Monday . No one was injured in the incident . The Kudankulam police , who conducted an investigation , said the ongoing rivalry between two groups in the coastal hamlet could have been behind the latest explosion . The police said the country bombs made by one of the groups and concealed in the forest area might have gone off accidentally . Meanwhile , the Kudankulam police registered a case against 11 persons from Kooththenkuzhi for attempting to murder Sub-Inspector of Police Thirumurugan by running a sand-laden lorry on him . The police said the mini-lorry with the illegally quarried sand was intercepted by the police near Kooththenkuzhi intersection on Sunday night during a vehicle check . However , the illicit sand miners tried to mow down Mr.Thirumurugan and escaped . However , the police officer escaped unhurt . Subsequently , the police registered case against one Jesuvadiyan and 10 others . OPEN",
