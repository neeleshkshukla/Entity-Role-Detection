A Bench of Justices P. Sathasivam and B.S. Chauhan , while issuing the notice on 48 appeals after hearing Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam , posted the matter for final hearing to January 11 , 2011 . When asked by Justice Sathasivam as to why there was delay of 880 days in preferring the appeals , Mr. Subramaniam said the judgment , running to nearly 4,300 pages , had to be minutely examined by the prosecution before filing the appeal in each case . According to the prosecution , over 250 people lost their lives and 713 sustained injuries in 13 blasts in Mumbai on March 12 , 1993 . The special TADA ( Terrorist and Disruptive Activities -LSB- Prevention -RSB- Act ) court had convicted 100 people , including eight death sentences and 20 life imprisonments . A total of 51 appeals were filed by the accused , including actor Sanjay Dutt , who was sentenced to undergo six years imprisonment , while the State filed 48 appeals . OPEN",
