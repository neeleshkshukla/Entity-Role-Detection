VA member of the bomb disposal squad defuses live bombs found after a search operation by NIA teams in RanchiRanchi : 27 live bombs have been found in a room of a privately-run small hotel in Ranchi , the capital of Jharkhand and around 350 kilometres from Patna.The bombs were discovered when the National Investigation Agency or NIA along with the Jharkhand Police raided the hotel after a tip-off that Haider Ali , one the main suspects in the serial blasts that hit Patna last month , hours before a Narendra Modi rally , might have been seen there . Four people have been detained for questioning but there have been no arrests.The police said they worked till late last night to defuse the explosives , which were pipe bombs , nine bundles of three each and very similar to those that went off in Patna . A senior cop said they also found `` timer devices with lotus branding , '' much like the ones that were found in Patna and also in the Bodh Gaya blasts in Bihar some months ago.The bombs found in Ranchi were powerful ; one of these bundles could have killed about 15 to 10 people and injured another 50 , the police said . Six people were killed and 83 injured in the Patna attack , which investigators link to a newly-formed branch in Ranchi of terror group Indian Mujahideen , though it has not claimed responsibility.Haider Ali is among the six accused of the attack . Last week , the NIA raided a village in Jharkhand to find him but he managed to escape.Investigators say Haider Ali is allegedly in close touch with Tehseen Akhtar , who has been effectively running the Mujahideen since its reported co-founder Yasin Bhatkal was arrested in August.Those handling the case say that Haider Ali passed on instructions from Tehseen Akhtar to the man assigned to execute the attacks , Imtiaz Ansari . He was arrested while trying to run away from the train station where the first of seven bombs exploded in Patna.Another 11 bombs were found and defused in the city . .
