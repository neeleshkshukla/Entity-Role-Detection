S'In a desolate field outside Kabul , an Afghan soldier hunches over a knee-high robot equipped with cameras , multidirectional pincers and tank-treads built for rough terrain . Carefully , he attaches four bottles of water and a tiny explosive charge to the robot . He uses a remote control to guide it 50 metres away to his target a simulated backpack bomb . Explosion ! Explosion ! Explosion ! shouts the soldier , Naqibullah Qarizada , in a warning to others nearby . Then he remotely detonates the charge . A small dust cloud kicks up . If all has gone well , the blast has pushed the water into the bomb with enough force to knock out its triggering mechanism . But to be safe , his partner , Hayatullah , climbs into a heavy protective suit before lumbering over to pluck out the blasting cap and seal it in a fortified box . The two men are among hundreds of Afghan soldiers training to take over the dangerous fight against the wars biggest killers the Taliban-planted bombs that kill and maim thousands of people each year on and around the countrys roads and towns . A few years ago , there were almost no Afghan bomb disposal experts . Now , there are 369 but thats far from enough . The international coalition is rushing to train hundreds more before the exit of most coalition forces by the end of next year . Each day on average , two to three roadside or buried bombs explode somewhere in Afghanistan , according to numbers compiled by the United Nations , which says that the explosives killed 868 civilians last year , 40 per cent of the civilian deaths in insurgent attacks . Among international forces , buried or roadside bombs accounted for 64 per cent of the 3,300 coalition troops killed or wounded last year , the NATO force says . Known in military parlance as improvised explosives devices ( IEDs ) , the bombs have long been a favourite Taliban weapon that can be remotely detonated by radio or mobile phone when a target passes by or triggered by pressure , like a vehicle driving over it . The U.S. military has over the years developed advanced detection and disposal techniques that manage to defuse about 40 to 50 IEDs each day , says Colonel Ace Campbell , chief of the Counter-IED training unit . The coalition is working to transfer that knowledge to the Afghans who will be responsible once most foreign troops leave next year , and Colonel Campbell says Afghan teams are now finding and disposing about half of the bombs most days . Whenever I hear about an IED or I find one myself maybe you will laugh , but I become very happy , says Mr. Hayatullah ( 28 ) , who has completed the highest level of training . I am happy because it is my duty to defuse it , and I will save the lives of several people . AP OPEN'
