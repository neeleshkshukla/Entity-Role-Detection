Assistant Commissioner of Police ( Madhurawada ) K. Rajendra Rao said that it emerged from a preliminary inquiry that K. Prasad , a cellphone mechanic , and Arasavilli Vinodh ( 19 ) were making cracker bombs in the house of the former . The explosion occurred when Vinodh was engaged in making bombs . At the time Prasad had gone out on an errand . The bombs made of sulphur and potassium went off , ripping the outer portion of the building . The impact of the explosion was so powerful that Vinodh died on the spot . According to local people , a gas cylinder exploded simultaneously . All the household goods suffered extensive damage . The blast ripped apart wooden furniture and refrigerator , besides causing massive cracks on the walls and sunshades . Lakshmi , living in the neighbourhood , suffered minor injuries and was in a state of shock . The injured were rushed to the King George Hospital where they were given first aid .
