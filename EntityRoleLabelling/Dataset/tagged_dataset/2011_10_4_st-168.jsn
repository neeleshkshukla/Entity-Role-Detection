    "content": "Judicial Magistrate III ( in-charge ) Arunachalam on Monday granted the Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) of the State Crime Branch CID time till 4 p.m. on October 29 to produce Kerala-based People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) leader Abdul Nasser Maudhany . The case relates to the planting of a bomb inside a telephone booth at the Coimbatore Press Club on December 30 , 2002 . The SIT had obtained a production warrant from the Coimbatore court against Mr. Maudhany and formally recorded his arrest in the Bangalore prison where he is lodged in connection with the Bangalore bomb blasts case . It had also obtained a Prisoner Transit Warrant to bring him to Coimbatore . Subsequently , it encountered problems in bringing the PDP leader here . SIT sources said that initially , the issue was that Mr. Maudhany 's presence was needed in Bangalore for the blasts case trial . Then arose the question of who should provide escort Karnataka police or Tamil Nadu police . It stood resolved now with the Tamil Nadu Police tasked with bringing him to Coimbatore on October 29 after their election bandobust duty is completed . Citing his health condition , the PDP leader is said to have expressed inability to travel to Coimbatore either by train or road . The issue of bringing him by flight with police escort has to be decided by the Tamil Nadu government , the sources said . The idea of producing Mr. Maudhany before the magistrate in Coimbatore through videoconferencing was not found to be legally permissible . The sources pointed out that the law mandated that the accused be produced in person for the first time in the case . Videoconferencing could be resorted to only for remand extension . Maudhany lodged in Bangalore prison in Bangalore bomb blast case Tamil Nadu Police entrusted with task of bringing him to Coimbatore OPEN",
