The original components of the explosive were ammonium nitrate , nitrite and TNT . Now , in the house , we found TNT , other explosive material and also traces of RDX , ATS chief Rakesh Maria told The Hindu . The agency received the chemical analysis report a couple of days ago . Mr. Maria said : There was no RDX at the blast sites . The three bombs , which went off at Zaveri Bazar , Opera House and Dadar on July 13 , were a mixture of ammonium nitrate , nitrite , petroleum hydrocarbon and TNT . RDX was recovered in a flat in Habib building at Byculla in south Mumbai . Naquee Ahmed , Nadeem Sheikh , Kanwar Pathrija and Haroon Naik have been arrested in connection with the blast . Of them , Naquee and Nadeem are accused of staying with the absconding accused at Habib building , where IM operative Yasin Bhatkal allegedly took residence for a while . Naquee 's arrest was mired in controversy . The Delhi Police blamed the ATS for botching up their operation to nab Yasin Bhatkal in Mumbai by arresting their informer Naquee . OPEN",
