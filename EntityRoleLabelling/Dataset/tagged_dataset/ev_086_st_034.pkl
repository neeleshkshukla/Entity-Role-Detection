VShiv Sena today said it was wrong for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to equate Mumbai terror attacks with those in Afghanistan . . . `` We elect you to protect us . When you compare the Mumbai attacks to those in Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan . It is an insult to those killed in these attacks , '' Sena MP Sanjay Raut said . . . A case of treason should be filed against Rahul Gandhi over these remarks , he said . . . `` Rahul does not leave a single chance to insult Mumbai . When he says the terror attacks will continue to happen , it shows that he is not fit to live in India , '' Raut said . . . Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi today said that 99 per cent of the terror attacks had been stopped in the country due to improved intelligence , but admitted that it 's difficult to stop all terrorist attacks . . . `` We will stop 99 per cent attacks . But in one per cent they will get through . . It is something we will fight and we will defeat , '' he told reporters at Bhubaneswar this morning on the second day of his 2-day tour to Orissa . . . To a question how US was able to stop any terrorist attacks on its soil , Rahul said the US soldiers were taking the hit in foreign shores like Afghanistan and Iraq . . . Referring to Wednesday 's attack , Gandhi said the response of the government was prompt . `` We are responding to it in a quite organised fashion . '' .
