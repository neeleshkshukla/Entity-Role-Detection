S'A woman , who witnessed the horrific Boston bombings , was reminded of the deadly 2008 attacks in Mumbai , a city she was visiting when Pakistani terrorists went on the rampage killing 166 people . Stephanie Douglas had come to cheer her friend Linda Claire Willits at the Boston Marathon when two bombs exploded , killing three people and injuring over 140 on Monday . The two blasts occurred within seconds on a sidewalk along the 42-km route of the marathon , where thousands of people had lined up to cheer on the marathoners . Ms. Douglas couldnt help but think of November 2008 when she was in Mumbai when deadly shooting and bombing attacks carried out by the LeT claimed 166 lives , including that of six Americans . This is twice Ive been in two cities when this kind of thing has been happening , she was quoted by CNN as saying . After crossing the finish line of the Boston Marathon , Ms. Willits texted Ms. Douglas , who was waiting down the street at the bar at the Mandarin Oriental hotel . Im on my way , Ms. Willits said . As Ms. Douglas prepared to celebrate , a small explosion went off , followed seconds later by a thunderous boom that tore through the area . It was so strong the bar filled up with smoke and chairs tipped over , she said . I saw people it was like they were on a trampoline literally flying through the air . Smoke poured into the bar . People began shouting that another bomb had been found , and everyone scrambled to escape . Outside , one mans legs were blown off , and he kept trying to stand up , she said . Ms. Willits , who was en route to meet Ms. Douglas , said , The whole ground shook , and I knew right away it was a bomb . I saw people who had lost their limbs , she said . Ms. Douglas knew Ms. Willits was somewhere in the vicinity when the blasts went off . After all , shed gotten the text from her . Everything that could go wrong was going through my head , she said . Minutes seemed like hours . Finally , Ms. Willits daughter managed to get hold of both of them by phone and coordinated their reunion . Ms. Willits waited at a street corner for nearly an hour . We were both already crying and just embraced each other , she said . It was a meltdown , Ms. Douglas added . Shock waves This has been a traumatic event , Willits said between tears . But I just feel like we cant stop doing things that we enjoy doing , because then the terrorists win . A 78-year-old veteran American runner , knocked down by the huge impact of the two bombs that hit the Boston Marathon , has become an Internet sensation after he managed to get up and finish the race . Bill Iffrig was yards from the finish line when the explosion was detonated . Video and pictures from the scene show Mr. Iffrig , in bright orange vest , on the ground , trying to get up . With the help of a race official who lifted him to his feet , he got up and kept going , determined to reach his goal . I got down to within 15 feet of the finish apron and just tremendous explosion , he told CNN . The shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around , he said . But , he said after running 26 miles he wasnt going to give up . - PTI OPEN'
