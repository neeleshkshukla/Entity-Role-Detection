VJAIPUR/UDAIPUR : Illegal Bangladeshi migrants in Rajasthan will be identified in 30 days and could be deported as they came under the scanner of the state government after the serial blasts while a hotelier claimed he saw one of the suspects in Udaipur two days before the attack . With the Bangladesh-based HuJI being suspected to be behind the blasts , state PWD Minister Rajendra Singh Rathore said the state government is on a hunt for Bangladeshis with suspected criminal background . Forty such Bangladeshi nationals have been rounded up so far and are being interrogated , he said . Eight of them were detained in Ajmer . All District Collectors and Superintendents of Police have been directed to complete within 30 days the process of identifying Bangladeshi migrants living with or without voter ID cards and/or ration cards and get them verified , Rathore said . The procedures for deporting the identified illegal nationals could then be started , he said . The process has begun everywhere in the state , he added . The State 's Principal Home Secretary discussed with his central counterpart on Friday the option of deporting illegally staying Bangladeshi nationals , he added . The owner of SamorBagh restaurant in Udaipur Kamal Joshi was interrogated by police after he claimed on Friday that a person bearing resemblance to one of the sketches of suspects released on Thursday night was seen along with a woman in his restaurant on Sunday evening .
