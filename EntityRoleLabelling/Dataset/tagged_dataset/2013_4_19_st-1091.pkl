S'A day after the bomb blast that took place near its office here , the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party trained its guns on the UPA government at the Centre on Thursday by alleging that terrorists and anti-national forces were feeling safe under its regime . Addressing a meting of the BJP election management committee , party national vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi accused the Congress-led UPA of badly managing the countrys security . The first thing that they did after assuming office in 2004 was abolishing The Prevention of Terrorism Act , 2002 , he said and alleged that the country had been witnessing major terror attacks once in every two months after the UPA took over . Replying to queries by media persons , he did not agree with the suggestion that the blasts were an indication of the failure of the BJP administration , especially Home Minister R. Ashok . The BJPs view is that national security is the responsibility of all political parties and all Indians . It is not proper to look at the issue from a political perspective , he said . At the same time , he urged the Election Commission to provide adequate security to the people during the Assembly elections , in the wake of the blast . After the declaration of model code of conduct , the Election Commission will have a major role in issues such as security , he said . OPEN'
