During an in-chamber hearing , District Judge I. S. Mehta allowed the National Investigation Agencys ( NIA ) plea seeking custody of Syed Maqbool and Imran Khan to confront them with another alleged IM operative Obaid-Ur-Rehman , who has been brought from Bangalore Central Jail and is in NIAs custody till March 20 in connection with the case , sources said . Maqbool and Imran were brought from Tihar Jail after the court had on Friday issued production warrants against them . Sources said the NIA told the court that they need to confront both Maqbool and Imran with Obaid-Ur-Rehman as some conflicting statements have been given by them during their separate interrogation . The two were earlier remanded to NIAs custody for five days by the court during which they were taken to Hyderabad in connection with the blasts . Rehman was remanded to NIAs custody on March 13 after the agency had submitted that his custodial interrogation was required to unearth the entire conspiracy which led to the bombings . He was brought from Bangalore jail after the court had issued a production warrant against him . - PTI OPEN",
