The explosive device , which appeared to have been planted underground , detonated as the convoy of four vehicles entered the town of Daraa , cradle of a 14-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad 's regime . Major General Robert Mood of Norway , the head of the UN mission , was in the convoy but escaped unharmed along with 11 other observers and his spokesman Neeraj Singh , said the photographer who was travelling in the convoy . The bomb attack was the latest breach of a month-old ceasefire agreement that UN-Arab League envoy Annan said could be the last chance to avert a civil war in Syria . Opposition bloc the Syrian National Council accused the regime of being behind the blast . OPEN",
