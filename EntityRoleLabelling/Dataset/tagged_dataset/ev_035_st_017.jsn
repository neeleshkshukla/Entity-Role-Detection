Nabla or Ranjan Daimary -RRB- , was held in Bangladesh and handed over to the Border Security Force late on Friday night . . . BSF authorities , in turn , handed him over to the Assam police and he was brought to the city on Saturday . He is likely to be produced in court here on Sunday . When contacted , Subhash Ch . Das , Principal Secretary , Home , did not divulge where and under what circumstances Daimary was arrested and details of the Bangladesh Rifles handing him over to the BSF in the Dawki sector of the border . . . Assam blasts . . The 51-year-old insurgent leader was wanted in a number of cases including the October 30 , 2008 serial blasts in Assam in which 88 persons were killed , at least 540 were injured and public property worth Rs .2.99 crore was damaged . Interpol also issued a Red Corner notice against him . . . The Central Bureau of Investigation , in its charge sheet filed on May 25 , 2009 in connection with the serial blasts , named 19 persons , including Daimary , accused . Its investigation revealed that the nine serial bomb blasts in Guwahati , Barpeta Road , Bongaigaon and Kokrajhar were triggered by the NDFB . . . Daimary had been president of the NDFB since its inception on October 3 , 1986 . The outfit was originally known as the Boro Security Force and re-christened the NDFB in 1993 . . . However , the NDFB general assembly on December 15 , 2008 replaced him by B. Sungthagra -LRB- alias Dhiren Boro -RRB- . But , 12 days after his removal , Daimary claimed that he was still president . . . On January 1 , 2009 the NDFB expelled Daimary for his alleged involvement in the October 30 , 2008 blasts . This split the outfit into two , with one faction led by Sungthagra known as the NDFB -LRB- ceasefire -RRB- and the other as the NDFB -LRB- Ranjan Daimary -RRB- . . . Daimary earlier initiated the NDFB 's peace process , declaring a unilateral ceasefire with the government of India on October 8 , 2004 , for six months and it was extended for another 3 months . He signed a bilateral agreement on Suspension of Operation with the Centre on May 25 , 2005 . . . However , he later went underground and operated out of his bases in Bangladesh along with armed cadres of the third battalion of the outfit .",
