S"A bomb explosion on Sunday killed at least 33 people in Pakistan 's northwestern city of Peshawar , officials said - the third deadly strike to hit the city in the last week . The blast took place in the busy Kissa Khwani market in Peshawar , gateway to the troubled tribal regions which are infested with Taliban and Al-Qaeda linked militants . `` The blast killed at least 33 people and wounded more than 80 others , '' top local administration official Sahebzada Muhammad Anis told AFP . An official at Peshawar 's Lady Reading Hospital , Jameel Shah , also confirmed the toll . Local officials said the blast took place near a police station but they did not initially believe the station was the intended target . `` Police station does not seem to be the target as it was away from the attack site , '' bomb disposal chief Shafqat Malik said . He said , `` It looks like the market was the target . `` He told AFP the evidence suggested it was a remote controlled bomb . `` In fact , the whole car , which had been parked along the roadside , was converted into a remote controlled bomb , '' he said . Sunday 's attack was the third major bombing to strike Peshawar and its suburbs in the past seven days . Last Sunday a twin suicide attack at a Peshawar church killed 82 people , triggering countrywide protests by the Christian community and members of the civil society demanding better protection for Pakistan 's minorities . On Friday , a powerful bomb tore through a bus carrying government employees on the edge of Peshawar city , killing 18 people . Peshawar runs into the semi-autonomous tribal belt that U.S. officials consider a safe haven for Al-Qaeda and insurgents fighting both in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan . The umbrella Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan faction has led a bloody campaign against the Pakistani state in recent years , carrying out hundreds of attacks.AFP OPEN"
