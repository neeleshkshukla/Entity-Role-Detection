    "content": "BANGALORE : There 's a certain inevitability about it . It 's now almost a pattern that terrorists strike even before the nation recovers from its last shock , to leave it traumatized again.The target this time was Bangalore , the country 's IT capital , which has been in the terror shadow for long . The city became a target of eight serial blasts on Friday , leaving one dead , eight injured and the city scarred . The bombs were of low intensity , aimed more at dislocating economic activity than killing hundreds of people . -LRB- Watch -RRB- Only in May , 68 people were killed by terrorists in Jaipur . Even as the police was groping to identify the culprits there , terrorists cocked a snook at the security agencies , triggering eight serial blasts in 35 minutes at seven places during the busy lunch hour . -LRB- In Pics : Bangalore serial bomb blasts -RRB- The lone victim was Sudha , who was waiting at the Madivala bus stand . Her husband Ravi , who was standing beside her , was severely injured . Two others Chetan and Gullamma were also injured.Police said the bombs were put together with ammonium nitrate , commonly used in gelatin sticks , and used nuts and bolts as shrapnel . Timer devices were used to trigger the blasts between 1.40 pm and 2.15 pm in non-descript places on a traffic island , inside a drain , a vacant plot next to a vehicle showroom . As word of the blasts spread , malls , cinema halls and schools shut down for the day.No group claimed responsibility until late Friday , but intelligence sources said Lashkar-e-Taiba and SIMI were main suspects . ` The aim of these groups , whether Huji , LeT or SIMI , is clear . Bangalore and Hyderabad are chosen because by hitting them , panic can be conveyed to US and the west as these cities house their biggest IT operations , ' said a security official involved in the Mecca Masjid probe .",
