Buddhist monks all over the country feel saddened by the attack . The international community is also shaken . We try to put people on the right path and we have been made the target of a terror attack . The All India Bhiku Sangha condemns this attack . This should not have happened . We spread the message of peace across the world . This is an attempt to spread terror and create discord among the messengers of peace , Bhante Sadanand Mahasthaver , chairman of the Sangha , told The Hindu on phone from Maharashtras Wardha district . . . Mr. Bhante Sadanand said a likely impact of the conflict in Myanmar can not be ruled out as a possible reason for targeting the Buddhist community in this fashion . . . Bodh Gaya is the site that sent the message of peace to the world . Its a sacred site . It was the fountainhead of enlightenment and knowledge and education to the world . Many universities and centers of learning sprang from this site . Although India is lagging behind in education , it is considered to be gurudesh -LSB- teacher country -RSB- . There were many Buddhist Universities here once and India was the leader in education , Bhante Sadanand said . . . Mahabodhi temple at Bodhgaya is a world heritage site - inscribed in 2002 . Bodh Gaya is associated with the enlightenment of Lord Buddha -LRB- 566-486 B.C. -RRB- . The sacred Bodhi tree under which he is believed to have attained enlightenment . The place is highly venerated by the Buddhists .",
