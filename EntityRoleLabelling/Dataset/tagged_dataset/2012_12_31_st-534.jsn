    "content": "Amid the relentless surge in terrorist attacks across Pakistan , 41 people have died over the weekend in two separate incidents . While the bodies of 21 of the 22 Levies personnel abducted on Thursday were recovered on Saturday night , 19 Shias were target killed in Mastung area of Balochistan en route a pilgrimage to Iran . The lone Levies staffer who survived the shooting succumbed to injuries on Sunday . So frequent have the attacks become that people seldom have time to absorb news of one attack when another takes place . In a reflection of how much these attacks have become business-as-usual , the cricket match with India in Chennai was trending within hours of the bomb attack in Mastung on most television news channels . A bomb was placed in a car parked on the route of three buses taking the pilgrims , and triggered with a remote controlled device . The buses were moving in a convoy with nearly 180 Shia pilgrims . The blast set off a fire in one bus as a result of which most of those killed had burns . Over a score were injured . No organisation claimed responsibility for the blast . This is not the first time buses travelling to and from Iran with mostly Shia pilgrims have been targeted in Mastung which is close to the provincial capital of Quetta . As for the Levies personnel , their bodies were found in a ditch in Kohi Hassan Khel the very area from where they were kidnapped after three of their checkposts were attacked by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) . The TTP had claimed responsibility . Prior to the discovery of their bodies , the government had sought the help of tribal elders in locating the personnel . As it also served an ultimatum on the two dominant tribes to recover the personnel by Monday , they constituted teams to secure release and arrange for ransom if the need arose . Such attacks have become business-as-usualTTP claims responsibility for Levies attack Such attacks have become business-as-usual TTP claims responsibility for Levies attack OPEN",
