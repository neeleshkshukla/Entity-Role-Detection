With no terror group claiming responsibility for the deadly terror strike and the lack of clinching evidence to indicate the involvement of pan-Islamic organisations or right wing terror outfits , forensic data became the soul source to draw inferences . The bomb signature - usage of factory-made ammonium nitrate like supergel and detonation with timers - swung the needle of suspicion towards the banned Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , which is believed to behind similar blasts earlier . The latest terror attacks in IMs account - August , 2012 , in Pune and February , 2011 , in Mumbai - are akin to those at Dilsukhnagar since improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) were detonated with timers . Compelled by this evidence , agencies probing the incident are racking their brains to identify as to who could have engineered the blasts . But they are not prepared to name the IM as the organisation behind the attacks . OPEN",
