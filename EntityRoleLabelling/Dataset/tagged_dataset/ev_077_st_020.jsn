    "content": "This refers to the article Ahmedabad blasts : the usual suspects -LRB- Aug. 1 -RRB- . Indian Muslims are peace-loving . It would be better for national integration if stories and articles of sacrifices made by Muslims for their country and their achievements are published , instead of repeating the views of the lunatic fringe gone astray . . . Indian Muslims proudly sing sare jahaan say achcha Hindustan hamaara and are second to none in patriotism . Let the author give some useful suggestions to enable the police and intelligence agencies to nab the culprits who plant bombs and kill innocent people . They belong to no religion . . . V.M. Khaleelur Rahman , . . Ambur . . By reproducing the so-called manifesto of an unknown organisation , which has the most blasphemous content against a religion , the article has given legitimacy to it . There are umpteen organisations with radical ideologies which civil society can not accept . One hopes such content will not be published in future . . . Rettavayal S. Krishnaswamy , . . Chennai . . P. Malhotra , . . New Delhi . . Rashid G. Khan , . . Aligarh . . The media must observe caution , and refrain from dragging the names of religious scholars who work tirelessly to eliminate antipathy among people . . . Yasir Malik , . . New Delhi . . What is the solution ? Prompt apprehension and punishment of miscreants by the government could have averted many disasters . Sadly , the wheels of justice turn in an excruciatingly slow manner . The sane majority can make a difference by reassuring those affected and providing physical , financial and , most important of all , psychological help to them . Religious leaders should invite them to walk the tougher path of forgiveness and forbearance . . . Thehseen Zakir , . . Kochi . . It is worrisome that a bomb blast in any corner of the world spells trouble for Muslims . Whether or not a Muslim is attached to an organisation , he or she feels suspected , secretly followed , and directly or indirectly targeted . In this sense , every blast is an attack on Islam and Muslims . . . Ustad Humaid , . . New Delhi . . Ajmeera A. Azeez , . . Alwaye .",
