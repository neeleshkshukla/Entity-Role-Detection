VMUMBAI : Seven persons walked out of two Mumbai jails on Wednesday evening after having spent five years in the dark , dingy cells . Free for now , the seven were greeted with hugs , tears , smiles and sweets , as the wait finally ended for the them as well as the dozens of people who had lined up to meet them outside the prison gates . The seven , accused of planning and executing the 2006 Malegaon serial bomb blasts , were recently granted bail by a MCOCA court . ` We were framed in these cases . We want our dignity and five years back , ' a statement said . The anger at the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad -LRB- ATS -RRB- was also evident , with the seven men later alleging that the agency had been biased in its probe . On September 8 , 2006 , four RDX bombs went off in Malegaon , killing 31 people . On Wednesday , six of the accusedSalman Farsi , Mohammed Zahid , Raees Ali , Shabbir Masiullah , Noor-ul-Huda and Dr Farog Makhdoomiwere released from the Arthur Road prison , while Abrar Ahmed stepped out of the Byculla jail . Two others Mohd Ali Shaikh and Asif Bashir Khan alias Junai who were also granted bail would remain in jail as they are also accused in the 7/11 serial train blasts . All seven men released were keen to reach home . ' I am happy that we have been released . But I will find peace only when I am discharged from the case , ' said Farsi , tears in his eyes . ` We want our dignity back . We want an answer as to why the police wrongly framed us , ' maintained Raees Ali . Zahid said , ` The police showed me as a planter , but I was 500km away from Malegaon . The truth is coming out now . I will be relieved when we are acquitted , ' said Masiullah . Times View The NIA 's decision to not oppose bail to these accused in the 2006 Malegaon blasts case based on a review of the evidence suggests that it has prima facie reached the conclusion that they are innocent of this crime . If so , merely releasing them from prison five years after the event is clearly not enough . From a civil rights point of view , each of them must be paid a compensation of not less than Rs 5 lakh per year for wrongful confinement if the police ultimately admit that they were innocent . The investigating agencies also need to introspect on the damage done to their credibility and the fuel such incidents provide to fears that community profiling underlies their investigations .
