S'One person from neighbouring Ghaziabad has been detained by the Delhi Police in connection with the low-intensity explosion outside the Delhi High Court earlier this week . He has been identified as Gulfam . A Delhi Police team picked up Gulfam from a village in Pilkhuwa on Thursday . They are looking for one Nafees as well . But he has not been traced so far , said a senior Uttar Pradesh police officer . No official confirmation However , there was no confirmation from senior Delhi Police about the detention . Informed sources claimed that the detention came following scrutiny of calls made from near the Delhi High Court around the time of the blast . Investigations revealed that several calls were made to Pilkhuwa and Hapur minutes after the blast from a phone which was traced to Nizamuddin just before the blast . The Delhi Police Special Cell then conducted raids in Nizamuddin and questioned a large number of people . It led the police to Gulfam . The police also procured the duty chart of the parking lot attendants and security guards at the Delhi High Court and questioned them for any information about suspicion elements loitering around in the area in the past few days . Report awaited Though the police have so far maintained that it was a low-intensity explosive device as even the car under which it was placed was not badly damaged , the forensic report is awaited to reach any conclusion on the composition of the bomb .
