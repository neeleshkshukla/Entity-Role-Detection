VSpecial Correspondent . . KLO suspected to be behind the act . . KOLKATA : At least 10 persons were killed and nearly 50 injured in a powerful blast inside a compartment of the Haldibari-Siliguri Passenger train at Belacoba station in West Bengal 's Jalpaiguri district at around 6.20 p.m. on Monday . The condition of some of those injured was said to be critical . . . Unconfirmed reports said that the explosion had claimed at least 15 lives . . . The Kamtapur Liberation Organisation -LRB- KLO -RRB- , a militant outfit that has been active in north Bengal in the recent past and which has links with the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- , is suspected to be behind the explosion . This , however , is yet to be officially ascertained . . . The KLO has been demanding a separate state of Kamtapur to be carved out of large parts of north Bengal and some districts in neighbouring Assam . . . For the first time in the State an explosion of such intensity has occurred , the State Home Secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said . The death toll could rise , he feared . . . Senior police officials have rushed to the spot and the State Government has ordered an inquiry into the incident , Mr. Roy said .
