S"A powerful bomb blast ripped through a crowded metro station in Minsk , capital of Belarus , on Monday evening , killing 12 and injuring more than 200 people . The bomb went off in a central metro station during the evening rush hour . Police said it was a homemade explosive devise , equivalent to seven kg of TNT and packed with nails and bolts . It was hidden under a platform bench on Oktyabrskaya station and was apparently detonated by remote control as a train pulled up . Eleven people died on the spot and one more person succumbed to injuries later ; 204 people were admitted to hospital , 26 of them in serious condition . The scene of carnage captured on cell phone cameras was eerily reminiscent of the bombings of the Moscow metro in 2010 and the Domodedovo airport in January this year . Oktyabrskaya station is one of the busiest among Minsk 's 25 metro stations and lies at the only intersection of the city 's two lines just a hundred metres away from the presidential headquarters . Police qualified the blast as a terror attack and detained several suspects with the help of identikit portraits on Tuesday , hours after Belarus ' autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko told the security services to turn everything inside out in their search for the culprits . In televised remarks , Mr. Lukashenko said the attack may be linked to an unsolved explosion during Independence Day celebrations in 2008 , in which 50 people were hurt , but no one died . We must find out who stands to gain by undermining peace and stability in the country , said Mr. Lukashenko . The Belarus KGB secret service said they had three theories for the bombing motives : an attempt to destabilise the country , an act of revenge by extremist organisations or a hit by a mentally ill person . Investigators said they were looking for a man of non-Slavic look . No one has claimed responsibility for the attack so far . Opposition in Belarus voiced fears that Mr. Lukashenko could use the bomb attack as a pretext to step up political persecution in the post-Soviet state , which he has ruled since 1994 . Dozens of opposition leaders were arrested in the wake of a presidential election last December for staging protests against what they claimed was an unfair vote . OPEN"
