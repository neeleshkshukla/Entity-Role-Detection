National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Wednesday arrested four Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) operatives in connection with the October 2 , 2014 blasts . The accused have revealed to NIA that they had set up a burqa stitching unit as a front for assembling bombs in Beldanga , West Bengal . This unit was also being used to recruit people for terror activities and training them . The accused have been identified as Dalim Sheikh alias Faijul Hoque Sheik , Motiur Rehman alias Noor Alam , Habibur Rehman and Ghiyasuddin Munshi . `` JMB had set up a tailoring unit in which its members used to stitch burqas . This , however , was a front for using the site to assemble bombs . The unit was run by Motiur Rehman , a close associate of Shakil Ghazi who was killed in the October 2 blast . Rehman was also responsible for maintenance of hideouts and recruitment , '' said an NIA officer . Dalim Sheikh and Habibur Rehman , according to NIA , are top commanders of JMB and were involved in recruitment , training and arranging of finances . Dalim is a full-time member of JMB and was involved in setting up bases and hideouts for the outfit , raising and collecting funds , radicalizing Indian citizens and providing tactical and material support to their senior Bangladeshi associates in spreading the network of JMB in India , said NIA sources . `` Dalim was heading the Nanur Madarsa in Bolpur . He used to spot potential recruits and then give them `` daawat '' ( invitation ) to JMB , '' said the officer . Habibur , on the other hand , is a very close associate of JMB India chief Sajid alias Sheikh Rahmatulla who was arrested earlier by NIA . He used to maintain and run the terrorist training camp from Mukimnagar Madarsa in Murshidabad district , said sources . Munshi , according to NIA , was a trained JMB member along with his wife and was engaged in providing hideouts to senior members of the outfit . NIA has till now arrested 16 people in the case and found that the outfit had established its network in different districts of West Bengal , Assam and Jharkhand - particularly in Murshidabad , Nadia , Malda , Birbhum and Bardhaman of West Bengal and Barpetta of Assam apart from Sahibganj and Pakur of Jharkhand . The investigations have also revealed that senior members of JMB had established terrorist training centres and bomb making units in Beldanga and Mukimnagar of Murshidabad , Nanur of Birbhum and Khagraghar and Simulia of Bardhaman district .
