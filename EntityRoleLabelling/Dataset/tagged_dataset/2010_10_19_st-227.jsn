    "content": "The Bangalore city police are contemplating seeking Interpol 's help to arrest at least six more persons allegedly involved in the serial blasts that rocked Bangalore on July 25 , 2008 , killing a woman . The police arrested two suspects from Kerala Umar Farooq of Malappuram and Ibrahim Moulavi of Wayanad last Friday . They are being interrogated at an undisclosed place . Police sources said that even more were probably involved in the blasts , eight of whom have fled the country , while another is in Kerala . We have interrogated Farooq and Moulavi . They have given us useful information about the blasts , a Central Crime Branch officer said . Maudany 's associates Farooq and Moulavi are close associates of People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) leader Abdul Maudany , prime accused in the blasts . They knew Maudany for the past 15 years and visited Bangalore several times before the blasts , the officer told The Hindu . The police are collecting evidence against the accused and will shortly submit an additional charge sheet in court . If possible , the city police will submit the documents pertaining to the serials blasts to the Interpol Wing of the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to issue a red corner notice , said the officer , who wished to remain anonymous . He described Farooq and Moulavi as experts in making crude bombs using ammonium nitrate . They are also associates of Lashkar-e-Toiba operative Thadiyandavide Naseer , he said . Thirty-two persons were charged by the city police in the first charge-sheet filed in court . As many as 19 persons , including PDP leader Maudany , have been arrested , while four were killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir . OPEN",
