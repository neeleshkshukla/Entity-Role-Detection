    "content": "The death toll from a bomb attack in Pakistan 's troubled southwestern city of Quetta rose to 15 on Friday after seven people injured died overnight in hospital , police said . The dead included five students from the seminary where the bomb exploded as people gathered to attend a degree ceremony . The 10 others were teachers , employees and relatives of the students , police said . `` Seven more critically injured died in hospitals overnight . A total of 30 people , including students , were wounded in the blast , '' Abdur Rahim Khokhar , a local police official , told AFP . Khokhar warned that the death toll could still rise further . Police said six kilograms ( 13 pounds ) of explosives were planted on a bicycle , parked outside the seminary and covered with garlands . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack . Quetta is the capital of Baluchistan province , which borders Afghanistan and Iran . Baluch rebels rose up in the province in 2004 , demanding political autonomy and a greater share of profits from oil , gas and mineral resources in the region . It is one of the most deprived regions of Pakistan despite its wealth in resources , and human rights activists have heavily condemned the military for summary arrests . AFP OPEN",
