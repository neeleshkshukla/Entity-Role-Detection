VGuwahati : Suspected ULFA militants triggered two blasts close to a police station in Nalbari on Sunday , killing at least six persons and injuring 50 others . The first bomb , planted in a bicycle , went off at a spot adjacent to the police station at around 9:30 am , Superintendent of Police Jitmol Doley said.A similar blast occurred minutes after in front of a mobile phone shop , about 20 metres away from the police station , as people were trying to flee from the area , he said.Vehicles parked in the busy and crowded area were damaged due to the impact of the blasts.The areas where the blasts took place have been cordoned off by the police , which was carrying out a combing operation in the area.Prima facie the blasts seemed to be the handiwork of ULFA , according to police sources . The deceased have been identified as Keshab Das , Dipu Das and Ganesh Das , all local residents , and Pavan Thakur from Bihar , Doley said.A high alert has been sounded across the state in view of the blasts and people have been asked to remain indoors by the district administration . -LRB- With PTI inputs -RRB- .
