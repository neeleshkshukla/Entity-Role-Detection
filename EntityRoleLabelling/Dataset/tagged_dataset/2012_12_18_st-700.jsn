    "content": "A car bomb attack killed 17 people and wounded around 70 on Monday in a Pakistan market in the northwestern town of Jamrud , close to the Afghan border , officials said . The bomb exploded in a small market near a bus stop , killing and wounding people waiting for buses to take them across the northwest and to other parts of the country , according to officials . Pools of blood and charred pieces of human flesh littered the roadside , along with at least 20 burnt vehicles , said an AFP reporter . Clothes , school books , children 's shoes and burqas lay everywhere . Jamrud is in Khyber district , which is part of Pakistan 's semi-autonomous tribal belt where the Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked groups have strongholds . A government office of the district administration was around 100 metres from where the bomb detonated but was not damaged in the attack , according to an AFP reporter . `` At least 17 people were killed and 71 others wounded in the blast caused by an explosive-laden car , which had been parked very close to the waiting area for passengers , '' Khyber 's most senior administration official , Mutahir Zeb , told AFP . He said ordinary civilians and not the government office , some distance from the explosion , were the target . `` We are still ascertaining what procedure was exactly used to blow up the vehicle , '' he said . `` The blast also damaged 10 vehicles and more than 15 shops in the market , '' Azam told AFP .
