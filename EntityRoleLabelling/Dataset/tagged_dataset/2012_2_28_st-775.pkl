S'Thai police said on Monday that they were holding a third Iranian for questioning in connection with an alleged plot to kill Israeli diplomats in Bangkok . The man , who has denied any links to a string of botched blasts in the Thai capital on February 14 , was charged with overstaying his visa , said the police . According to Thai media , mobile telephone call logs showed he had been in regular contact with two Iranians now in custody , one of whom was badly hurt as he hurled a bomb at police while fleeing . An Iranian couple were also taken in for questioning but were later released because police found nothing to indicate they were involved . AFP OPEN'
