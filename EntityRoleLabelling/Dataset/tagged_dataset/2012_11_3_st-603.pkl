S'A girl was injured when she opened a parcel bomb disguised as a gift packet at Haldiapadar village under Golanthara police station limits on the outskirts of the city on Friday . A similar gift packed explosive was located in front of another house of the area . But it had been diffused by some one by the time police reached the spot . The police seized batteries , detonator , and gun powder from the diffused parcel bomb . According to inspector in charge of Golanthara police station , P.K. Mishra , the blast occurred in the early morning . The victim was Jayanti Behera ( 17 ) of Pandara Street of Haladiapadar . She lived with her brother Kalia Behera and mother Gouri Behera . When Gouri opened gate of her house in the morning she found a gift packed transparent plastic box kept at her door steps . As per a card on this box it was meant for Jayanti and Kalia . As Kalia was not at home , Gouri handed over the box to her daughter Jayanti . From outside it was evident that the box contained a metal chain that sparkled like gold . The girl took the box inside and opened it . As soon as she opened the box it exploded injuring her . The injured girl was immediately shifted to MKCG Medical College Hospital for treatment . The other box which was diffused by some unknown person was found at a distance of 100 metres from the house of Jayanti . The box contained a metal bracelet to dodge its possible victim . As per investigating police officials , both the parcel bombs were handiwork of a single man as their modus operandi was the same . Police also suspected that some miscreants who may be irked with the girl may have resorted to this action . The girl was allegedly receiving prank calls for the past few days . Investigation is on . A middle aged woman of Golapalli area of the city was injured when a similar parcel bomb exploded on August 5 in 2009 . OPEN'
