S"Observing that the examination of the 750-odd prosecution witnesses in the 2008 Delhi serial blasts cases will take more than six years to complete if the trial proceeds at the current pace , a Tis Hazari Sessions court on Wednesday decided to expedite the trial by holding more hearings and summoning more witnesses on each hearing date . Thirteen persons , eleven of them lodged at Ahmedabad 's Sabarmati Central Jail , are accused in the 2008 serial blasts which left 26 people dead and injured over 100 persons . Additional Sessions Judge Santosh Snehi Mann noted that there were 750 prosecution witnesses in the five consolidated blast cases , of whom 29 witnesses have been examined till date in six hearings . On an average five witnesses have been examined per hearing . These cases are taken up on the second and fourth Wednesday of every month that is , two hearings are scheduled in a month . With this pace , it will take more than six years to examine the remaining prosecution witnesses . Directive Ms. Mann directed that henceforth the blast cases would now be listed for hearing every Wednesday and at least 15 witnesses would be summoned for each hearing . In her order , the judge wrote : The trial needs to be further expedited keeping in view the nature of cases , gravity of offences , and the fact that more than two dozen precious lives were lost and more than 100 innocent people were injured and maimed in the serial bomb blast , which not only created terror amongst common people but also challenged the existence of a democratically elected welfare State . Ms. Mann further pointed out that the State was expected to ensure that public witnesses appear to depose in court during trial without any fear or inducement . Needless to say that threat perception be assessed under supervision of the Commissioner of Police and all necessary steps be taken accordingly . The court also took a dim view of some doctors not appearing in court against the summons issued to them . It also issued a bailable warrant against a doctor who refused to receive the summons issued to him twice . OPEN"
