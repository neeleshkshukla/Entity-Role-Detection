    "content": "Barely two days after capturing the alleged bomb-maker in the Ajmer dargah blast case , the Rajasthan Anti-Terrorism Squad has arrested an anti-cow slaughter activist from Godhra in Gujarat on charges of planting the bomb at Ahata-e-Noor in the Sufi shrine on October 11 , 2007 , leaving three persons dead . Remanded Mukesh Vasani , 42 , was arrested from Godhra on Wednesday and produced in a court in Ajmer on Thursday . He has been remanded to police custody till November 9 . Additional Director-General of Police ( ATS ) Kapil Garg said here that this was the fifth arrest in the case , coming just two days after an alleged key conspirator Harshad Bhai Solanki was nabbed in Vadodara . Harsdhad reportedly revealed the name of Mukesh during interrogation . Mr. Garg said Mukesh was entrusted with the task of planting the bomb on the dargah premises by the main accused and the mastermind , Sunil Joshi , who was later murdered at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh in 2007 . A resident of Kalal Darwaza near Ice Factory in Godhra , Mukesh worked as a building contractor and is believed to be a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist associated with the campaign for a ban on cow slaughter . Mr. Garg said Mukesh was an important ingredient of execution of the bomb blast and had admitted to having planted the bomb at the courtyard opposite the mausoleum in the dargah . The bomb exploded at the time of Iftar , when the devotees were breaking the Ramzan fast . Harshad , who happens to be a main accused in the 2002 Best Bakery carnage in Vadodara as well , is also in police custody till November 9 . He was absconding since 2004 and he allegedly conspired with Sunil Joshi during the period of hiding to carry out the dargah blast . The arrest of Mukesh is a major breakthrough for ATS , which has so far captured the accused involved in the conspiracy for gathering the bomb-making material , assembling them , packaging bombs to Ajmer and triggering the blast . The latest arrest exposes the man who actually planted the bomb . RSS link Mukesh is the fourth accused with the suspected RSS links apprehended in the case , while Harshad is believed to have strong Vishwa Hindu Parishad links . The investigation and arrests by the ATS , along with the reference to RSS leader Indresh Kumar in the charge-sheet , have revealed the Sangh Parivar 's links to the blast case . The ATS had filed its charge-sheet in the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate 's court in Ajmer on October 22 against five persons Devendra Gupta , Lokesh Sharma , Chadrashekhar Lave and two absconding accused Sandeep Dange and Ramji Kalsangre .
