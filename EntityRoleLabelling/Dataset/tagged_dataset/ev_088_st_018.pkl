On Wednesday , four low intensity explosions took place between 7.37 and 8.15 pm during rush hour in the heart of Pune on Junglee Maharaj Road , crowded with restaurants , shops and the large Sambhaji Park , popular for family outings in the evening . . .

The first bomb went off at Balgandharva Theatre where one person identified as Dayanand Patil was injured . . . The National Investigation Agency , Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad and Pune crime branch have been conducting the probe into the blasts simultaneously . . . The investigators have also approached mobile operators to verify if any new numbers were traced in and around the spots on the fateful day . . . `` We have approached mobile companies seeking the details of new numbers or suspicious numbers their towers have captured before and after the blasts .
