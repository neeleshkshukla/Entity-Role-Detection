S'Special Correspondent NEW DELHI : An assistant driver was injured in a bomb blast triggered on the tracks on Wednesday , even as the two-day bandh by the CPI ( Maoist ) affected train movement at various points . The CPI ( Maoist ) targeted a goods train carrying petroleum product in the wee hours of Wednesday on the Gidhni-Jhargram section under the Kharagpur division of South East Railway . The bomb on the track shattered the windshield of the loco injuring assistant driver M.K.D. Poddar . Movement of trains was suspended as the blast caused a two-foot deep crater and damaged two concrete sleepers . The Maoists caused a second blast , similar in intensity , on the same section about a km away . It damaged two sleepers and resulted in a two-foot crater . After security clearance , restoration work was undertaken . Sabotage thwarted Another attempt at sabotage on the New Delhi-Howrah section late on Tuesday night was thwarted by an alert gateman after he sighted about 10 to 15 people placing banners and flags and posters saying that a bomb had been planted on the track . Patrol vans rushed in and detected two bombs within a space of a kilometre on the Ismailpur-Guraru stations in Gaya district under the Mughalsarai division of East Central Railway . Bomb detection and disposal squads arrived from Gaya and defused both the explosives . Train services resumed after a delay of over seven hours . The affected trains included Duronto and Rajdhani series . The disruptions led to cancellation of 11 trains and rescheduling of nine others . Eighty-six others , including five Rajdhanis , were regulated . OPEN'
