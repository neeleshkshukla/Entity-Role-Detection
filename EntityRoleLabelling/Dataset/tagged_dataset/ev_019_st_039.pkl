VBurdwan : The Central investigators probing the October 2 blast in West Bengal 's Burdwan , found at least 30 hand grenades in the toilet of a house near the site - one that was searched and sealed by the state police eight days ago.The Bengal police had raided the house - on Badshahi Road - on October 8 after questioning the two women arrested from the house in Khagragarh , where the blast took place . The house was vacant at the time of the raid - half-a-dozen men living there who claimed to be masons , had decamped . Among those absconding is one Rezaul , suspected to be a key Jihadi element . But today , the sniffer dogs of the National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- and the National Security Guards -LRB- NSG -RRB- found the bombs - bolstering the Opposition claims that the state police are hiding evidence at the behest of the ruling Trinamool Congress.The BJP 's Siddharth Nath Singh , in fact , had 10 questions for the Mamata Banerjee government , including one regarding the `` conspiracy '' that `` forced her government to allow evidence at Burdwan to be destroyed . `` The Trinamool snapped back , asking what Mr Singh 's locus standi was anyway . Ms Banerjee was in Jhargram , where she did not refer to the Burdwan blast except to call for communal harmony . `` We should all live in peace but there are some mischievous people who do n't want that , '' she said.Earlier today , the NIA-NSG teams combed a madrasa at Simulia with bomb detectors . They also detained two relatives of the absconding principal Yusuf Sheikh.During its probe that began on Sunday , the NIA had found material suggesting the madrasa may have been used as a hub by jihadi elements linked to the Burdwan blast . Air gun pellets , sharp-edged weapons , money receipts and jihadi literature - including a Bengali book titled , `` How To Die A Good Death '' - were found , said sources . .
