We have got CCTV footage from all the three locations . We are going through it , ATS chief Rakesh Maria said . The ATS and the Crime Branch police were jointly investigating the case and more than a dozen teams have been formed to crack it . We are probing all the possible angles . We are being closely assisted by the Central agencies.Today , in less than 24 hours after the attack , we can not rule out any possibility , Mr. Maria said . According to a police source , a body had an embedded electronic circuit . Mr. Maria , however , refused to confirm reports that human bombs might have been used . It is too early to say whether human bombs were used or not . I do n't want to disclose anything which hampers the investigation . Police have not been able to figure out where exactly bombs were placed . We have taken samples from all spots . There is a huge amount of debris . The sifting is going on . It is too early to say whether it was placed in a container , a box or a vehicle , Mr. Maria said . OPEN",
