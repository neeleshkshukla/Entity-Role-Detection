S"A group of heavily armed Pakistani Taliban militants on Thursday detonated an explosives-laden truck at the office of the Crime Investigation Department ( CID ) , which is spearheading the drive against terrorists in the southern port city of Karachi , killing at least 18 people and injuring 115 others . The attackers exchanged fire with guards outside the CID office , located in a high security zone at a short distance from the Chief Minister 's official residence and several five-star hotels and consulates . After getting past a barricade and disrupting power in the area , the attackers detonated the explosives-laden truck at 8.17 p.m. ( local time ) . The powerful blast destroyed the facade of the CID office and reduced the nearby Civil Lines police station to rubble . It also uprooted trees , blew out windows of nearby structures and shook buildings located several kilometres away . Officials told the media that at least 18 people were killed and 115 others injured . The dead included several policemen and security personnel . The relatives of policemen , including women and children , living in nearby residential quarters were among those injured . Sindh Home Minister Zulfiqar Mirza compared the attack to the suicide car bombing at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad that killed nearly 60 people in September 2008 . The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the blast and warned that it would carry out more attacks if its demands were not met , Geo News channel reported . It could not immediately be ascertained whether the attackers were killed in the blast . There were conflicting reports on the number of militants involved in the attack . The area around the CID office was cordoned off and an emergency was declared in hospitals . PTI OPEN"
