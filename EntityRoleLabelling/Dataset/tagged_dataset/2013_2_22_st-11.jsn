    "content": "Hours after a series of bomb blasts rocked the Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad on Thursday evening , police sources in Delhi claimed that two suspected members of a terror outfit who were arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell last year had spoken of conducting a recce of the area in July 2012 . The claim is likely to raise questions about what the Delhi Police did with this information , and whether their counterparts in Hyderabad were alerted about the possibility that terrorists might target Dilsukhnagar . According to Delhi Police sources , the two suspected members of the Indian Mujahideen who were arrested from Hyderabad in October 2012 told interrogators that they had conducted reconnaissance of different parts of Hyderabad in July . They disclosed that they had carried out a survey at Dilsukhnagar and Begum Bazar in Hyderabad on a motorcycle to identify places that could be targeted . The Special Cell said it cracked their module following purported revelations by Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal , an alleged handler of the 26/11 Mumbai attack . With police claims about Islamist groups being behind various bomb blasts in Hyderabad eventually turning out to be incorrect , police officers in the city have been guarded about speculating on the record about who might be responsible for Thursday 's bombings .
