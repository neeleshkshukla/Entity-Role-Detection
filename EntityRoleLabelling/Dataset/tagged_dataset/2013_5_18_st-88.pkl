S'The special TADA court here has issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against two convicts of the 1993 Bombay Bomb blasts case for failing to surrender before the court on Friday . Special judge G.A. Sanap issued the warrants against Zebunnisa Kazi ( 70 ) and Shariff Parkar ( 80 ) . Both had sought permission from the court to appear on a later date citing health reasons . Kazis lawyer Farhana Shah argued that she is suffering from a kidney tumour and hence , could not surrender and would do so on Monday . She also informed the court that Parkar had suffered a cardiac arrest and is now admitted in Prince Ali Khan Hospital here . The court , however , issued the warrant against both . Kazi has been sentenced to five years imprisonment by the apex court for her involvement in the blasts , while Parkar has been sentenced to life imprisonment . In April , appeals filed by both to give a months reprieve before going to jail were accepted by the Supreme Court on health grounds . The court , however , did not allow any further time to anyone to surrender on any ground . OPEN'
