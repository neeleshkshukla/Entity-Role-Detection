VFive persons were killed and four others seriously injured when a bomb exploded on board the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express as it passed through Assam 's Golaghat district early today . . . The blast took place around 1 am in a coach next to the engine as the train moved from Naojan to Chongajan railway station . The Adivasi National Liberation Army -LRB- ANLA -RRB- owned up for the attack . Earlier , officials too had suspected the outfit which has of late been active in the region . . . A National Security Guards team will visit Assam tomorrow to assist in the investigation , a Home Ministry official said in Delhi . Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta spoke to the Assam Chief Secretary to take stock of the situation . . . `` Preliminary reports suggest it could be the handiwork of the ANLA which had announced recently it would indulge in acts of sabotage , '' said Khagen Sharma , Assam 's IGP -LRB- Special Branch -RRB- . The ANLA is believed to have a cadre strength of 70-80 . . . Railway PRO Trikalagya Rabha said the blast took place in a non-AC compartment behind the engine and it was so powerful that it left a crater 1.8 metres wide and 82 cms deep on the railway track . Two bodies were found inside the coach while three lay by the tracks . . . There were 40 people in the coach , known as an SLR van , half of which is used for luggage .
