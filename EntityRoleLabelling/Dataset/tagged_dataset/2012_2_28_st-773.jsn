Two individuals died on the spot , while a third succumbed to injuries at the hospital . A little known group , Samyukta Jatiya Mukti Morcha ( United Ethnic Liberation Front ) , called up a private television channel to claim responsibility for the blast . It said the blasts were to protest against the recent fuel price hike . Home Minister Bijay Kumar Gachhedar inspected the site and visited the injured at the hospital . The opposition accused the government of not providing even minimal security to citizens . OPEN",
