A decision has been taken to withdraw cases against Shamim in the Varanasi blast case . The District Magistrate of Varanasi has been asked to approach the local court there in this connection , said a senior Home Department official . The absconding Shamim , who was never arrested in the case , is accused of having planted a bomb , which remained unexploded , at Jamuna Fatak in Godaulia area at Dashashwamedh Ghat . The bomb was recovered soon after twin blasts in the Sankatmochan temple and cantonment area of Varanasi on March 7 , 2006 , which killed 21 persons . The U.P. special task force had arrested one Waliullah , the imam of a mosque , for being the alleged mastermind behind the blasts . He is currently lodged in Dasna jail . In 2008 , following the Batla House encounter in New Delhi , one alleged Indian Mujahideen member was arrested who is said to have confessed to being involved in the planting of the unexploded bomb . - PTI OPEN",
