    "content": "Series of attacks target Shia worshippers BAGHDAD : A series of bomb attacks mainly targeting Shia worshippers killed 58 people on Friday , including 25 near the main Baghdad office of an anti-U.S. Shia cleric , said officials . The violence demonstrated militants remain a potent force days after Iraqi authorities announced the killing of the top two Al-Qaeda in Iraq leaders in what they described as a major blow . Extremists are also seeking to exploit political deadlock after the inconclusive March 7 parliamentary election and ignite sectarian warfare as U.S. forces prepare to go home . The biggest of Friday 's bombings took place just a few hundred yards from the compound of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in Baghdad 's vast slum of Sadr City as worshippers gathered for Friday prayers . Two car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded around 1:30 p.m. , killing 25 people and wounding an estimated 150 , according to hospital and police officials . The blasts left blood streaming down muddy streets . Men carried victims away using bed sheets as makeshift stretchers and loaded them into the backs of trucks and rushed them to the hospital . One man fled carrying a young girl whose pink dress was stained with blood . Many who gathered at the scene pelted Iraqi security officials with stones when they arrived in the area , frustrated with their apparent inability to secure the city . Security officials fired in the air to disperse the crowd . Bombings elsewhere in Iraq most of them targeting Shia worshippers killed 33 other people in one of the deadliest days the country has seen in weeks . AP OPEN",
