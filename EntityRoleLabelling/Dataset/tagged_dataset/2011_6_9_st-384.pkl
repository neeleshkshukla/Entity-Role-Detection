S"A powerful explosion ripped through a three-storey residential building in Nashik on Wednesday afternoon , killing three persons and injuring seven . The Nashik police have not confirmed the reason for the blast yet . Whether it was a cooking gas cylinder leak or whether the raw material from a nearby firecrackers godown caused the blast was being investigated by the police . The blast occurred around 3 p.m. on the ground floor of the Saptshrungi Apartments in Nashik 's Panchavati region . The apartments housed 11 families . A cyber caf , a jewellery shop , and a tailor 's shop are located on the ground floor of the building . Fire Force teams , forensic experts , and a bomb disposal squad reached the site within an hour . The ground floor and the first floor were destroyed in the blast . Only one of the dead persons has been identified as Ravindra Vishwakarma . The identity of the other two , which includes a woman , was unknown . The injured have been admitted in the civil hospital in Nashik . Residents who were rescued feared that the building might collapse because of the explosion . Meanwhile , eyewitnesses said they had seen a car emptying some goods on the ground floor . Some people came in a car which had a Rajasthan number plate and were talking loudly in Hindi . hey emptied some big boxes on the ground floor near the cyber caf and left , said Shrikant Sutar . According to the eyewitnesses , the blast occurred within an hour after the car left . The police said the eyewitnesses ' version would be taken into account in the process of the investigation . Sources in the police said the cyber caf owner had given a room on rent as a godown for raw material for firecrackers . Some firecrackers were found in a car parked outside the building . Whether the boxes seen by the eyewitnesses had the raw material for firecrackers was not known yet . The police had started investigating into this , sources said . The cyber caf owner Sham Gawai was taken into custody by the police for inquiry . Manohar Durwani , firecracker merchant , had not yet been traced by the police . Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan , who was in Nashik for a public function , visited the civil hospital and declared Rs . 1 lakh as compensation for the families of the dead , and Rs . 50,000 for the injured . I request people not to spread rumours . The police are carrying out the necessary investigations , he said . Home Minister R.R. Patil told presspersons in Mumbai that preliminary inquiries suggested that this could be a cylinder blast . The real reason can be ascertained only after an inquiry . The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad , forensic teams , and the fire brigade are on the spot . It was a residential area . Earlier , such high-intensity blasts have taken place in the State , he said . The police have not ruled out the possibility of the blast being a terrorist activity . Additional Chief Secretary ( Home ) Umesh Chandra Sarangi said the police had cordoned off the area and evacuated nearby building . Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) teams from Mumbai , Pune , and Aurangabad reached Nashik later in the day to investigate the cause of the blast . ATS Deputy Inspector-General Sanjay Latkar said : It will be premature to comment before the forensic report is out . The port-mortem of the victims will make it clear whether it was some explosive material that caused the blast or if it was a gas leak . The intensity of the blast is much larger than that of a gas cylinder . All angles will be looked into . OPEN"
