S"The Supreme Court has ordered acquittal of three main accused in the case relating to a bomb blast at the RSS office in Chennai and directed their release forthwith . The TADA court in Chennai had awarded life imprisonment to them . A Bench of Justice B. Sudershan Reddy and Justice S.S. Nijjar allowed the appeals of Kaza Nizamuddin , Hyder Ali and Abubucker Siddique challenging the life sentence and dismissed the CBI 's appeals questioning the acquittal of some of the accused by the TADA court . The prosecution case was that on August 6 , 1993 , there were loud explosions which resulted in the death of 11 persons , injuries to seven , and complete demolition of the building . Writing the judgment , Justice Reddy said , Excepting for the confessional statements , admittedly , there is no other independent evidence with regard to the participation of the accused in the conspiracy and the particular role played by them . It is apparent that even according to the prosecution version , they could have only carried bombs made from gelatine . The Bench , accepting the arguments of senior counsel R. Natarajan and counsel G. Balaji appearing for the appellants , said the confessional statements reveal that what was purchased was only gelatine sticks from Gudiyatham and not RDX or PETN , which has got a serious bearing on the acceptability of the confessional statements of the accused and their involvement of all the accused in the conspiracy . The lid on the prosecution case is blown away by the report of forensic experts and the traces of the explosive material collected at the bomb site . The prosecution story does not inspire confidence on the basis of the material placed on record , it said . OPEN"
