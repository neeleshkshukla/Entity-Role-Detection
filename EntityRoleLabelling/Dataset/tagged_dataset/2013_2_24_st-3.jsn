Addressing a media conference after a high level review meeting chaired by Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy , she announced a Rs . 10-lakh reward for those who would give information that could help solve the case . She said the government had decided to install closed-circuit ( CC ) cameras within the next six months at about 3,500 locations in the city at an estimated cost of Rs . 450-crore . . The government would make it mandatory to install surveillance cameras in malls , hospitals , cinema halls and other places which attract crowds . On the progress made by the investigators , she said : The Centre and State government are confident of achieving some breakthrough very soon . The Counter Intelligence Force of the State , those from CID and National Investigation Agency are on the job . Ms. Sabitha denied that the police had ignored any bomb threat call . The alleged involvement of Indian Mujahideen in the blasts was also yet to be established , she noted . In all , 16 persons were killed in the ghastly incident so far and 15 bodies were handed over to the family members concerned . Among the injured , condition of five to six persons was critical . Asked about criticism over alleged intelligence failure , she said investigation was under progress and if any laxity was found action would be initiated against those responsible . The Home Minister however added that the State had stepped up searches and checks whenever Centre issued alerts . The vulnerable areas were scanned thoroughly only 15 days ago yet unfortunately the bomb blasts could not be prevented . No arrest so far Meanwhile , the city Police Commissioner , Anurag Sharma told journalists that no one had yet been taken into custody so far and Abdul Wasey , twice-injured in terror attacks , was not a suspect in the case .
