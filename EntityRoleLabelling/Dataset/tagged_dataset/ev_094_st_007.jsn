Modi , on a day-long ` Santwana Yatra ' , had to come here to meet the family members of Munna Srivastava , who was killed in serial blasts at BJP 's Hoonkar Rally at Patna Gandhi Maidan on October 27 . Around 10,000 rural folks had assembled in the village right from morning to get a glimpse of Modi but they were disappointed when they were informed by officials and police that the helicopter of Modi returned to Patna due to poor visibility . Ram Pravesh Rai , Subhash Singh , Indradeo Manjhi , MLAs , former minister Janardan Singh Sigriwal , along with hundreds of supporters were waiting to meet Modi near the helipad but they had to return disappointed . Modi spoke to Soma Priya , the young widow of slain Munna , on telephone from helicopter . He told her that his party will take care of her , her daughter and her family . He also inquired from her whether her daughter goes to school . Initially , they talked in Hindi but soon Som Priya started speaking in fluent Gujarati . She told Modi that he was like her father and informed him that her daughter is just two-and-a-half year old . Munna owned a taxi . Priya told TOI that Narendra Modi offered his deepest condolences for the death of her husband in a bomb blast and assured all helps including the education of her child . Modi said a special messenger of his party would meet her within a day or two in this regard . All the family members of slain Srivastava were consoled by the crowd which had gathered at the village . They condemned the bomb blasts and shouted ... ` Modi zindabad ' . Priya 's father worked at Surat and she had studied there .",
