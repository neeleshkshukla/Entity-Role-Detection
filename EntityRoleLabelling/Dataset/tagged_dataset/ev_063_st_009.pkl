VStaff Reporter . . No breakthrough yet ; local elements ' hand also being probed by the Special Cell of the Delhi police . . In many such cases , the motive is to create communal disturbance : police15 persons interrogated on Saturday In many such cases , the motive is to create communal disturbance : police15 persons interrogated on Saturday . . NEW DELHI : Though the Special Cell has been working round-the-clock on the twin blasts that took place at the Jama Masjid in the Walled City area on Friday , it has not achieved any major breakthrough . . . It is learnt that apart from the involvement of an extremist group , the angle of mischief by some local criminal elements is also being probed by the Special Cell . . . The use of a crude bomb , apparently assembled using materials easily available , indicates that someone who had no access to lethal explosives was behind the low-intensity blasts . . . Also , the culprits knew the bombs placed near the tank at the centre of the mosque would not cause much damage as it was an open area . ` In many such cases , it has been found that the motive is to create communal disturbance . As was seen in the recent blasts in Varanasi , ' said a senior police officer . . . Probe continues . . The police are also trying to find out if someone trained by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant Abdul Karim Tunda was involved in manufacturing the improvised explosive devices . ` As we are probing all possible angles , the role of Tunda 's men , some of who are still at large , can not be ruled out , ' said the police officer . . . Experts are trying to find out the unique features of the bombs used . . . ` In several cases , the type of bomb used provides valuable clues regarding the outfit behind the incident . Cadre-based organisations carry out all their attacks in a similar fashion , ' he added . . . On Saturday , the Special Cell interrogated about 15 people . Though a majority of them have been let off , some are still being grilled . Two of the 14 injured are still in hospital . . . Meanwhile , tenant verification drives in the capital have been intensified and guesthouses in the Walled City area , north-east Delhi and in south Delhi are being checked . But normality has returned to the Walled City area with many foreigners visiting the historic Jama Masjid on Sunday . . . Sketches likely . . UNI adds : The police are contemplating drawing sketches of suspects based on eye-witness accounts and the questioning of those ` detained ' . . . Though senior officials refused to say anything , sources said getting the sketches drawn could enlarge the ` search ' ambit and lead to possible clues .
