Chandra Sekharan has urged the Centre to establish a National Explosives Control Bureau -LRB- NECB -RRB- on the lines of the Narcotics Control Bureau . . . Condemning the bomb blasts , Prof. Chandra Sekharan said in a statement on Sunday that the time had come for the Centre to tighten the web of manufacture , possession , transport and use of explosives in the country as a whole . . . Though there were rules and legislation to prevent unlawful and malicious use of explosives , terrorists and other anti-social elements were not only using explosives meant for civilian activities , but also those exclusively meant for military operations , he said . . . Prof. Chandra Sekharan , who submitted proposals to the Centre for setting up the NECB and permitting the States to enact stringent laws , acknowledged that the country could not ban the production of explosives because they had their rightful uses in both civilian and military operations . . . However , the serial bomb blasts starting from those in Mumbai in 1993 to the present ones in Hyderabad showed the inadequacy in the system to prevent blasts in crowded places . . . Citing stringent regulations on the use of explosives that were in force in several countries , he said there were no similar provisions in any State or city in the country .",
