Coming down hard on the shoddy investigation , a Division Bench , comprising Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and G.P. Mittal , said : The nature of grave prosecution lapses , in regard to various issues such as lack of proof connecting some of the accused with the bomb incident , failure to hold TIP -LSB- Test Identification Parade -RSB- of articles and the accused , -LSB- and -RSB- not recording the statements of vital witnesses . underline not only its lapses and inefficiencies , but also throw up a question mark as to the nature and truthfulness of the evidence produced . In 2010 , Additional Sessions Judge S.P. Garg awarded the death sentence to Mohammed Naushad , Mohammed Ali Bhatt and Mirza Nissar Hussain and life imprisonment to Javed Ahmed Khan .
