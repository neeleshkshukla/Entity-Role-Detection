Terrorists used this vehicle extensively for travel between Ahmedabad and Vadodara , as per expressway records . It is possible that the bombers used Vadodara as the base for making bombs and also travelled to Surat in the vehicle during the period.The car used in the Civil Hospital blast had a fake registration number GJ 6D 9778 of a Vadodara two-wheeler . Inquiries revealed that the first record of the car 's movement was at the Vadodara toll plaza at 3 pm on July 3 , indicating that it was headed for Ahmedabad.Subsequently , movements of the car are recorded on July 7 , 8 , 9 , 23 and 24 . Police believe the bombs may have been brought to Ahmedabad just two days before the blasts.On July 26 , the car packed with IEDs and LPG gas cylinders became the spearhead of the terrorist operation , accounting for nearly two-third of the total casualties in Ahmedabad.Movement of the car bomb along ExpresswayJuly 3 Vadodara to Ahmedabad July 7 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 8 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 9 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 23 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 24 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-Ahmedabad .",
