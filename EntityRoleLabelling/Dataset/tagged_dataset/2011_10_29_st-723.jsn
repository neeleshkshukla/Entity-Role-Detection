The two injured students were Krishna Swain of class III and Hemanta Pradhan of class IV . They were admitted to the Bhanjanagar sub-divisional hospital for treatment . According to hospital sources , both of them are out of danger . Police started investigation into the reason behind the blast . According to eye witnesses , the blast occurred when the two students tried to connect a battery to the detonator . Krishna said he got the detonator from a garbage dump near a stone crusher unit that operates near their village . He brought it to school . He along with his friend Hemanta tried to connect a battery to the detonator out of curiosity . Such accidental blasts injuring children are not new to Ganjam district . In September 2008 , three rag-pickers of the city were seriously injured when they accidentally stepped on crude bombs hidden in a garbage dump . In the past , two children of Ambapua area of the city also sustained serious injuries when the ignorant children tried to play cricket with the crude bombs which they found from a field . They picked up the explosive from a garbage dump OPEN",
