VPakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayiba militant outfit , whose member was shot dead in an encounter with police near Lucknow on Wednesday , appeared prima facie behind the blasts in Varanasi , a senior Uttar Pradesh government official said in Varanasi on Wednesday . . . Principal Secretary ( Home ) Alok Sinha told a hurriedly called press conference that security agencies probing the blasts have been able to `` uncover '' that the LeT terrorist , who was shot dead in an encounter with the Special Task Force of the state police near the state capital , was involved in them . . . `` Prima facie , it appears that the slain terrorist was involved in the twin blasts but it would be a matter of investigation to ascertain the degree of his involvement or whether he was the mastermind , '' Sinha said . . . Asked specifically whether LeT was involved in the blasts , Sinha said it could not be said with certainty as yet but hastened to add that the terrorist outfit keep on changing their names and also their modules . To a query about the possible involvement of Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence , the Home Secretary said , `` It was difficult to say whether it was involved . '' . . In reply to a question , he said there was no specific intelligence information about the possibility of a terrorist attack in the temple city and added that , `` There never is any specific inputs on terrorist attacks . '' . . .
