S"At least a dozen people were feared killed and over 100 injured in three blasts that disrupted Youm-e-Ali ' the Shia procession to mark the martyrdom of Hazrat Ali in Lahore on Wednesday evening . The suicide bomb attacks were followed by mob ire on the police , resulting in stone pelting and the torching of vehicles of security personnel . The first two blasts took place near Karbala Gamay Shah , where the procession was headed . As panic-stricken members of the congregation fled the scene of the blast , a suicide bomber detonated himself at Bhatti Chowk in the vicinity , consuming the maximum number of lives and leaving a trail of injured people . Even as the injured were being rushed to hospitals , angry participants in the procession turned their anger to the police , leading to reports of violence breaking out in nearby areas . Lahore Commissioner Khusro Pervez told journalists that this was a very well-planned and coordinated attack as the suicide bomber the deadliest of the three attacks managed to penetrate the security cordon in the melee of the initial blasts . Gunmen open fire Ahead of the attack on the Lahore procession , gunmen opened fire at a similar procession near Empress Market in Karachi , injuring six people . The gunmen fired from atop a building along the route of the procession through Pakistan 's commercial capital . OPEN"
