VSaturday 's bomb blast in Mehrauli flower market has once again brought the legend of Abdul Karim Tunda back to life . The initial clues about the make of the bomb give it a striking resemblance to the bombs Tunda specialised in . . . What strengthens the idea further is that Abdul Halim Shamsullah Khan Pathan -LRB- 43 -RRB- who was arrested by Ahmedabad police soon after the Ahmedabad blasts had confessed to his links with Tunda . . . Pathan was accused of recruiting disgruntled riot-affected youth of Gujarat and sending them for terror training abroad . . . An expert in manufacturing bombs , Tunda is wanted in 33 cases under the Explosives Substances Act in Delhi and other states . His standard bomb cocktail consists of potassium chlorate mixed with sugar kept in a tight container packed with nails . In this container , amid the potassium chlorate mix , he packs in tiny bottles of homoeopathic medicines , filled with sulphuric acid . As soon as the container is tilted , the acid begins to seep out into the chlorate-sugar mixture . The package begins to emanate smoke and the blast follows . . . This is exactly what happened during Saturday 's blast . `` Eyewitnesses said smoke emanated from the polythene before it blew up , '' said a senior police officer . `` Also the fact that Pathan was found to be closely involved can not really be ignored , '' he added . . . Also , according to NSG officials , the bomb was crude and made of chemicals . The Joint Commissioner of the Special Cell , Karnal Singh , however said it was too early to comment . . . Abdul Karim got the nickname Tunda , after he lost an arm when one of his own bombs burst in his hand . . . Born to a lower middle class family in Delhi , he moved to Pilkhuwa near Ghaziabad . . . He briefly ran a homeopathic medicine store . After the business failed , he moved to Mumbai 's Mominpura and set up fabric dyeing business . . . ... contd .
