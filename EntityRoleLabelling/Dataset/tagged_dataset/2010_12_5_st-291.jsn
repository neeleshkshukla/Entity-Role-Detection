Shahina and others , Superintendent of Police Manjunath Annigeri told The Hindu here on Saturday . It is not a suo motu case , he clarified . Ms. Shahina and four others visited Hosathota in Somwarpet taluk last week , where K. Nasir , who was arrested in connection with the Bangalore bomb blasts case , stayed in the guise of a ginger cultivator until his disappearance months before the blasts in 2008 . Journalists in Kerala submitted a memorandum to their Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan expressing concern over the registering of cases . The two who lodged cases in Somwarpet and Siddapur were , earlier , witnesses to the case involving K. Nasir . They said they were questioned by strangers in an intimidating manner and it led them to suspect that they could be supporters of Abdul Nasir Maudany , who is also an accused in the Bangalore blasts case . We had to register cases given the sensitive nature of the issue , Mr. Annigeri said . The Somwarpet police verified that of the four persons who came with Ms. Shahina two were cameramen and the others drivers of the two vehicles by which they travelled . The police had to investigate the case as there could be truth in what the complainants had stated , Mr. Annigeri said . The district Crime Investigation Bureau inspector Krishna Kumar had been asked to probe the issue and he would submit a report to him soon , he added . OPEN",
