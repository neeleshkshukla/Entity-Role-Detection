S"Powerful explosions shook central Oslo on Friday afternoon , blowing out the windows of several government buildings , including one housing the office of the Norwegian Prime Minister . ( An AFP report said that in what seemed to be a related incident , a man dressed as a police officer opened fire at a youth camp at Utoya , an island outside Oslo , killing four people . ) Seven people were killed and several more injured in the blasts . A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said he was safe and not hurt . Stunned office staff and civil servants working in the vicinity of the bombed building said at least two explosions could be heard in close succession , as the sound of the blasts echoed across the city . Giant clouds of light-coloured smoke continued to rise hundreds of feet into the air over the city as a fire burned in one of the damaged structures , a six-storey office building that houses the Oil Ministry . The police said the initial blast occurred at around 3.20 p.m. local time . We think there was more than one blast , said Runar Kvernen , spokesman for the National Police Directorate under the Ministry of Justice and Police . The cause of the explosions was not immediately clear , but a Reuters reporter described seeing the mangled wreckage of a car near one of the buildings . Photos and television footage showed windows blown out in the 17-storey office building across the street from the Oil Ministry , and the street and plaza areas on each side were strewn with glass and debris . The centre of the city , Norway 's capital , was sealed off , and police said they were on heightened alert as they combed through the debris in search of clues . The explosions , which ripped through the cluster of modern office buildings around the Einar Gerhardsens plaza , occurred at a time when many Norwegians were on vacation and many more had left their offices early for the weekend .
