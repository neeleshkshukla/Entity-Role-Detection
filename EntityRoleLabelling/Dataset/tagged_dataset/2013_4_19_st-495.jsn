    "content": "The AP High Court on Thursday cancelled the bail granted by a sessions court to two accused Devender Gupta and Lokender Gupta -- in the Mecca Masjid bomb blasts case of 2007 . The lower court had granted bail to them five months ago . This grant of bail was challenged by the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) in the High Court . The High Court verdict has come as a relief to the NIA , which opposed the bail on the ground that it could hamper the investigations . Nine people were killed and over 60 injured in the powerful bomb blast during Friday prayers on May 18 , 2007 , at the 17th Century mosque . Sharma and Gupta , former members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , are among six accused arrested by the NIA in the case . Swamy Aseemanand , Bharat Mohanlal Rateshwar alias Bharat Bhai , Tejaram and Rajender Choudhary alias Samundar are the other accused in the judicial custody . Two others -- Sandeep V. Dange and Ramchandra Kalsangra -- are untraceable and on the run . OPEN",
