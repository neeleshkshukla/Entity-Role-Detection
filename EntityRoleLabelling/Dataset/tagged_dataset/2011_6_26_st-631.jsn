    "content": "Women and children among killed as maternity ward is hit A bomb at an Afghan hospital on Saturday killed at least 20 people including women and children , days after U.S. President Barack Obama said 10,000 U.S. forces would leave the country this year . The brazen suicide car bombing in Logar province , about 75 km south of the capital Kabul , also wounded over 20 people and officials warned the death toll could still rise . It was condemned in the strongest terms by the United Nations , which said the hospital 's maternity ward was badly damaged in the attack and many of the victims were women and children . Underlining the confusion and chaos at the site , the Ministry of Public Health initially put the death toll at 60 but later corrected its own figures . An eyewitness described horrific scenes of victims on fire and body parts scattered in all directions following the blast in the remote district of Azra , close to the border with Pakistan . The Taliban denied it was behind the attack , with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid saying : We condemn this attack on a hospital ... whoever has done this wants to defame the Taliban . Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as savage and ignorant in a statement released by his office . It came as Mr. Karzai told a counterterrorism summit in Tehran that militancy was on the rise in both his country and the region . Not only has Afghanistan not yet achieved peace and security but terrorism is expanding and threatening more than ever Afghanistan and the region , he told the opening session . The two-day summit is being attended by the heads of state of six regional countries , including Afghan neighbours Iran and Pakistan . The blast in Logar is the second major attack in Afghanistan in two days . On Friday , 10 people were killed by a bicycle bomb which went off in a busy bazaar in Khad Abad district of the northern province of Kunduz .
