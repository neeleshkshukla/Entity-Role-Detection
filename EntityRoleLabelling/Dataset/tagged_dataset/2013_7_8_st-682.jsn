Buddhists from all over the world visit the complex in Bihar state , which is believed to house the tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment in 531 BC . `` The holy Bodhi tree is safe and there is no damage to it , '' Bihar police chief Abhayanand told AFP . `` Eight low-intensity serial blasts took place early this morning , injuring two people , '' said senior police official S.K. Bharadwaj . Two more bombs were found and defused inside the complex , one of them near the temple 's celebrated 80-feet-tall statue of the Buddha , Bharadwaj told AFP . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts at the complex , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , saying `` such attacks on religious places will never be tolerated . '' Home secretary Anil Goswami called the blasts `` a terror attack '' but no one has so far claimed responsibility , according to the Press Trust of India . The national government has sent two teams of investigators to probe the blasts , said Goswami , the top interior ministry official . Attacks on Buddhists are rare in India but there have been tensions in the wider region recently following clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh . Additional security forces have been deployed to guard the temple complex after the blasts , which wounded two monks , a 50-year-old Tibetan and a 30-year-old Myanmar national . Both of them have been taken to hospital , local police official Bharadwaj said . Eyewitness and former local legislator Sarbajeet Kumar said he was on his daily morning walk to the temple when the bombs exploded . `` Suddenly I saw smoke and heard the sound of the blasts . I realised that something bad had happened and ran for shelter , '' he told local reporters.AFP OPEN",
