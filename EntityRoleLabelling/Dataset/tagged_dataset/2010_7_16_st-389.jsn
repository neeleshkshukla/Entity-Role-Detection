    "content": "The police have launched a quiet inquiry into allegations that the sound of an explosion was heard from the precincts of a religious place of worship in the city recently . Some local people , who claimed to have heard the blast , informed the police . They alleged that some radical elements had tested a crude bomb at the site . No casualty or damage to property was reported . The police have received no complaint from the custodians of the place . They were likely to forensically examine the spot for bomb residue if more evidence emerged . Law enforcers were concerned that explosives acquired legitimately for quarrying and fabrication of fireworks were diverted for illegal purposes . Bursting crackers at places of worship was a means of livelihood for scores of people . Some of them stocked low-grade gunpowder without licence or even after their licence period expired . There was a pressing need to audit their stocks and , if necessary , review their licences , officials feel . The police detected 31 instances of violation of the Explosives Act in 2009 . The number this year till May is 10 . The officials said crude bombs used for criminal activities , including poaching , were fabricated chiefly from explosives sourced illegally from stone quarries . The police said illegal diversion of explosives from fireworks makers and quarry workers were not easy to monitor , given the large number of them in the district . The use of thotta , ' a crude dynamite used for indiscriminate and destructive fishing , has been a constant source of tension between fishermen at communally sensitive coastal localities . Investigators suspect that Nitro-glycerine based explosives , such as gelignite , were being secretly traded in the State despite a ban on the possession and sale of such substances by the Chief Controller of Explosives in 2004 . The ban was imposed chiefly to prevent such lethal explosives from falling into the hands of radical elements . Recently , the police told the judicial commission inquiring into the Cheriathura firing that forensic experts had found a crude unexploded bomb fashioned out of gelignite sticks carrying the brand name NEO GEL 90 at the scene of the clash . They deposed that the same brand of explosives was also found at the sites of the terrorist bombings in Hyderabad and Jaipur in 2007 and 2008 respectively . The attacks had claimed over 100 lives in those cities . The Forensic Department 's scene of occurrence report stated that it was a powerful bomb which on explosion was capable of demolishing an area of 10 sq m. OPEN",
