S"Burhanuddin Rabbani , former President of Afghanistan and Chairman of the High Peace Council leading the year-old Afghan effort to negotiate with the Taliban was killed in a bomb blast at his residence in the centre of Kabul 's high-security diplomatic district . The bomb went off inside the house at 6 p.m. local time . Reports from Kabul suggested that he was meeting two members of the Taliban at the time of the blast as part of the ongoing efforts at reconciliation . One of them is understood to have detonated the bomb while the other survived the blast with injuries . He and the driver of their vehicle are in custody . The Associated Press quoted the chief of criminal investigation of Kabul Police , Mohammad Zahir , as stating that a turbaned man entered Prof. Rabbani 's house and blew himself up . Questions were being raised about how he accessed the house and the area without being frisked if that was the case . Speculation is that he concealed the explosive in his turban knowing well the reluctance of local security personnel to search the turban because it is seen as disrespectful . There is the possibility that Prof. Rabbani 's aides waived the security drill . Prof. Rabbani 's aides have apparently told the Kabul-based media that the Taliban members were carrying a message from the Quetta Shura the Afghan Taliban 's top leadership council , said to be based in Balochistan . Such was the veil of secrecy around the meeting that the former President 's staff got to know of it only a couple of hours before the Taliban members arrived . Another member of President Hamid Karzai 's reconciliation team Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai , who was at the meeting , was injured in the blast . The assassination of Prof. Rabbani who fought as a mujahideen against Soviet occupation and was president of Afghanistan for two short stints is seen as a big blow to the reconciliation process as he was someone who could rally the disparate Afghan groups . Meanwhile , there were reports quoting unnamed U.S. officials as stating that this attack , like the one last week in Kabul on the American Embassy , could be traced back to Pakistan and its deep state . At the same time , questions were being asked in Pakistan as to who stood to benefit most from sabotaging the ongoing efforts to reconcile with the Taliban . OPEN"
