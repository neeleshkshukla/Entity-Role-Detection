LUCKNOW : The investigating agencies have ruled out the use of RDX in Tuesday 's serial bomb blasts in Gorakhpur . . . Principal Secretary -LRB- Home -RRB- K. Chandramouli told newspersons here on Wednesday after his return from Gorakhpur that the blasts were caused by low intensity bombs kept in tiffin boxes attached to three new cycles . He said ammonium nitrate might have been used in the crude bombs . . . Mr. Chandramouli said the cycles were bought from different shops . The police had traced one shop and efforts were on to trace the others . The identification of the shops is expected to give crucial leads . . . He said six persons sustained minor injuries in the blasts and were discharged from hospital after receiving first aid on Tuesday . They were Guddu Chaubey , Rajesh Sharma , Sanjay Rai , Santosh Singh , Rameshwar Patel and Vivek Yadav . . .
