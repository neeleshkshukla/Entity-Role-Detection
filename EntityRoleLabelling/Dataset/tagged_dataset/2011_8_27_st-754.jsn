Witnesses reported that the bomb went off after a suspect forced his way through security and rammed the car into the building . Parts of the first two floors were blown out and rescue workers scrambled to rescue those left inside . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but an Islamist sect known as Boko Haram has been blamed for scores of bombings in recent months . U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the attack and said considerable casualties were expected . Mr. Ban said staff for 26 U.N. agencies and departments were in the building . AFP OPEN",
