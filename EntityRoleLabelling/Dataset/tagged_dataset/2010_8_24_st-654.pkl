S'The brief lull in bomb blasts across the country was broken on Monday when a suicide bomber detonated himself in a mosque in the South Waziristan tribal agency along the Afghanistan border killing 26 people and wounding almost as many . This was the deadliest of the three blasts that rocked the region already devastated by the floods ; the other two being in the Kurram tribal agency and near Peshawar . The three blasts together took over 35 lives including a former member of the National Assembly Maulvi Noor Mohammad and a member of the anti-Taliban militia . Mr. Mohammad was among those killed on the mosque in Wana , the main town of South Waziristan where the Army has conducted operations against militants . The suicide bomber apparently approached Mr. Mohammad known to be pro-Taliban while he was greeting people and detonated himself . In Kurram , a bomb went off in a school premises when tribal elders were in a meeting killing about half-a-dozen people . Since both these areas are among the seven agencies that make up the Federally Administered Tribal Agencies , government presence here is negligible and human rights organisations have time and again stressed the need to bring them under the ambit of federal law . The blast on the outskirts of Peshawar killed a leader of the anti-Taliban militia and a couple of his associates as he was passing by . The militia is being propped up by the government against the Taliban from within the community to serves as the eyes and ears of the establishment . OPEN'
