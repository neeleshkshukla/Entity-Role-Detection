S'Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , the Massachusetts university student who is a suspect in the Boston Marathon blasts , was on Monday charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction . He was accused of joining with his brother in setting off the shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs that killed three people and wounded more than 200 a week ago . Two U.S. officials said preliminary evidence from the younger mans interrogation suggests the brothers were motivated by religious extremism but were apparently not involved with Islamic terrorist organisations . The brothers , ethnic Chechens from Russia , had been living in the U.S. for about a decade . In the criminal complaint outlining the allegations , investigators said Tsarnaev and his brother each placed a knapsack containing a bomb in the crowd near the finish line of the worlds most prestigious marathon . The FBI said surveillance-camera footage showed Dzhokhar manipulating his mobile phone and lifting it to his ear just instants before the two blasts . After the first blast , a block away from Dzhokhar , virtually every head turns to the east ... and stares in that direction in apparent bewilderment and alarm , the complaint says . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , virtually alone of the individuals in front of the restaurant , appears calm . The criminal complaint shed no light on the motive for the attack . The Obama administration said it had no choice but to prosecute Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the federal court system . Some politicians had suggested he be tried as an enemy combatant before a military tribunal , where defendants are denied some of the usual constitutional protections . But Tsarnaev is a naturalised U.S. citizen , and under U.S. law , American citizens can not be tried by military tribunals , said White House spokesman Jay Carney . The next step in the legal process against Tsarnaev is likely to be an indictment , in which federal prosecutors could add charges . State prosecutors have said they expect to charge Tsarnaev separately in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was shot in his cruiser on Thursday night on the campus in Cambridge . Entitled to have lawyer After Tsarnaev is indicted in the bombing , he will have an arraignment in federal court , when he will be asked to enter a plea . Under federal law , as a defendant charged with a crime that carries a potential death penalty , he is entitled to at least one lawyer who is knowledgeable about the law in capital cases.Tsarnaev did not speak during Mondays proceeding , except to answer no when asked if he could afford his own lawyer , according to the notes . He nodded when asked if he was able to answer some questions and whether he understood his rights . A statement released on Monday by Kazakhstans Ministry of Foreign Affairs bolstered the U.S. officials comments about seeking details on the suspects other modes of communication and his associations . Two foreign nationals arrested on Saturday on immigration violations are from the central Asian nation and may have known the suspects , the Ministry said . U.S. authorities came across the students while searching for possible links and contacts . According to the criminal complaint , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had gunshot wounds to the head , neck , legs and hands when he was captured hiding out in a boat in a backyard in the Boston suburb of Watertown . The document included a chilling detail of the suspects flight from Cambridge : one of the brothers it wasnt clear which one told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt , Did you hear about the Boston explosion ? I did that . Shortly after the charges were unveiled , Boston-area residents and many of their well-wishers including President Barack Obama at the White House observed a moment of silence at 2:49 p.m. the moment a week earlier when the bombs exploded . AP Video footage shows Dzhokhar manipulating his phone moments before blasts , says FBITwo persons arrested in U.S. may have known the suspects : Kazakh Foreign Ministry Video footage shows Dzhokhar manipulating his phone moments before blasts , says FBI Two persons arrested in U.S. may have known the suspects : Kazakh Foreign Ministry OPEN'
