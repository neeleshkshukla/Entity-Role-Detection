    "content": "JAIPUR : The 280-year-old Pink City was smeared with blood . The peaceful city witnessed a never-before kind of bloodshed on Tuesday evening . Eight blasts occurred in six places within one kilometre of the walled city , when people including foreign tourists were either shopping or returning home from their work . The first blast occurred at Johari Bazaar , the jewellery market in the heart of the city and within 50 yards from this place , another one took place near the Hanuman Mandir at Sanganeri Gate , one of the five gateways to the city . Hawa Mahal , the palace of winds , which recently got a new coat of pink , stood a mute witness to the blasts that took place one after the other . The third one took place in Khanda near the Badi Chaupad , barely 30 yards away from Hawa Mahal and the fourth took place just outside the Manak Chowk police station near a shoe shop . Thus four blasts took place in close proximity of the Hawa Mahal , though they did not damage the structure . The fifth blast took place near Sargah Sooli , the tallest building towering over the city . It is located near Tripoliya Gate , which leads to the City Palace where the former ruler Brig Bhawani Singh resides . The Sargah Sooli is about 120 metres from Hawa Mahal . The sixth blast took place at the most crowded part of the city near the Hanuman Mandir at Chandpol Gate . The Sargah Sooli , the 20-metre high tower was used as the watch tower by the rulers of Jaipur . The terrorists chose Tuesday as they know that a large number of devotees of Lord Hanuman come to offer prayers at the two temples dedicated to Him . These temples are located at the two gateways of the walled city because as per mythology , Lord Hanuman is considered the god of strength and valour that would save the city from the enemies . The city witnessed two communal riots in the past 15 years in which many people died , but now the toll of serial blasts is higher than the two communal riots put together .",
