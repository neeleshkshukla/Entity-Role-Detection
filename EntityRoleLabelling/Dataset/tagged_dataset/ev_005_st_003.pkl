VNEW DELHI : Bomb blasts rocked Assam and Manipur during Independence Day functions injuring one person even as Chief Ministers asked extremists to abjure violence and return to the mainstream . . . In Srinagar , Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in his Independence Day address advocated resumption of dialogue with Pakistan as well as with the separatists to resolve the political issues of Jammu and Kashmir . . . `` Jammu and Kashmir is a political problem and can be resolved only through a process of dialogue.We have to start the dialogue process both internally as well as bilaterally ( with Pakistan ) for addressing this issue , '' he said at the Bakshi Stadium . . . He said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif should take steps for earning each other 's confidence to carry forward the dialogue process between the two countries . . . Omar also expressed concern over the recent ceasefire violations by Pakistan , saying such incidents were not good for the dialogue process . `` You violate the ceasefire , our people suffer.We retaliate , your people suffer.Guns can not be a solution , '' he said . . . The celebrations passed off peacefully in the state with no report of any untoward incident from anywhere in the Valley . . . In Bongaigaon in Assam , the anti-talk NDFB ( Sangbijit ) faction triggered serial blasts injuring one person in Kokrajhar district where the outfit exploded two grenades while another was triggered in neighbouring Chirang district . . . Bipul Brahma ( 45 ) was injured in one of the explosions in Kokrajhar.Another unexploded bomb was recovered from the district and defused . . .
