S'In yet another revelation , Abdul Karim Tunda , alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba ideologue , has said that back in Pakistan he was in regular touch with the former Inter-Services Intelligence chief , Hamid Gul . Till recently he maintained links with several other Pakistani intelligence officials also to garner support for terror activities in India . LeT is virtually an arm of Pakistans ISI through which young men were recruited on a paltry monthly allowance of roughly Rs . 4,000 for conducting ground operations . Tunda , who was once a very powerful figure in the Lashkar hierarchy , still wielded influence when it came to making recruitments for the outfit . During interrogation , he has disclosed that he was in direct touch with Hamid Gul , said a senior Special Cell officer of the Delhi Police . ( However , Mr. Gul told TV channels that he had never met Tunda . ) Tunda has purportedly told the interrogators that during 1996-98 , he sent his men to carry out blasts in and outside Delhi . The police suspect that his conduits carried out the blast outside the Police Headquarters in January 1997 . Since the CBI is investigating the case , it would interrogate Tunda to gather specific details . During questioning , Tunda has confessed to having masterminded the blasts triggered in 1996-98 , said the officer . The police would produce Tunda before a city court on Tuesday seeking further custody in a case registered at the Malviya Nagar station way back in 1994 . Seven persons were arrested in that case and a consignment of explosives was recovered from them . While two of the accused were acquitted , Tunda was declared a proclaimed offender . Tunda has disclosed that certain incidents -LSB- riots -RSB- reported in 1984 perturbed him and he took to extremism . A supplier of garments , Tunda learnt to configure pipe-bombs during a visit to Tonk in Rajasthan after he attended a meeting of the Ahle-Hadees sect there in 1985 . It was once while experimenting that a bomb exploded , amputating his left arm , said the officer . Tunda has disclosed that certain incidents -LSB- riots -RSB- reported in 1984 perturbed him and he took to extremism . OPEN'
