Fourteen persons , including a woman and two teenagers , had sustained various degrees of injuries in the blast and were rushed to the hospital . Most of them had injuries on their lower limbs . . . Officials at GH said the injured were : Shariful Haque -LRB- 27 -RRB- , Saren Barman -LRB- 31 -RRB- and Bimal Kumar Das -LRB- 43 -RRB- of Jalpaiguri , West Bengal ; G. Anjaneyalu -LRB- 29 -RRB- and Murali Loknath -LRB- 21 -RRB- of Andhra Pradesh ; G. Hari -LRB- 21 -RRB- and Jitendra Mohanta Deka -LRB- 51 -RRB- of Bangalore , Karnataka ; Sadan Chandra Debnath -LRB- 64 -RRB- and Sumant Debnath -LRB- 37 -RRB- of north Tripura ; Bijan Kumar -LRB- 14 -RRB- and Altaf Khan -LRB- 17 -RRB- of Manipurof Manipur ; Umari Hani -LRB- 45 -RRB- of Assam ; and Sagun Kumar Rai -LRB- 23 -RRB- and Krishna -LRB- 28 -RRB- of West Bengal . . . As the trauma and emergency surgical ward swelled with people , particularly mediapersons , security guards and police personnel struggled to manage the crowd . Soon , the ward was cordoned off , including for the media . . . The hospital authorities said this was one of the biggest cases handled by the hospital in the last five years , after two train accidents at Arakkonam in Vellore district in 2011 and 2013 . . . But we were able to manage the emergency situation . Doctors from various specialties were brought together to treat the injured immediately , said an official .",
