    "content": "MUMBAI : Repeatedly hit over a half-a-dozen times since the early 1990s , India 's financial capital has now become the favourite hunting ground for terror outfits . Over 600 people have died in these attacks . The macabre dance of death has unnerved citizens amid fears that Mumbai may go the Karachi way . Pakistan 's port city , barely 800km from Mumbai , has been wracked with violence and bloodbath over the past few years . ' I am shocked beyond words . It proves yet again Mumbai 's un-preparedness . Civilians are not on the radar of politicians , who live safely in their havens , ' said industrialist Dilip De . ` It looks like a repeat telecast of the same incident . Politicians have already started the blame game and now the candle vigil marches will begin . The term security no longer has any meaning . It 's a shame , ' said filmmaker and activist Ashoke Pandit . Former Mumbai police commissioner M N Singh , who headed the investigations into the serial blasts of 1993 , said Mumbai will continue to be the prime target . ` Mumbai has been attacked every three years since 2003 . The city has a strong network of IM and SIMI . While the police upgraded its infrastructure and equipment after 26/11 attack , the focus should be on how to curb radicalization of youth from the minority community , ' he said . Singh warned that the reasons behind the first serial blasts in 1993 which was in revenge for the demolition of the Babri mosque still remained unresolved . ` It has not come to a closure because the prime instigators still elude the authorities . Their role was visible in subsequent attacks , ' he added . Former state chief secretary D M Sukhtankar said Mumbai 's being the financial nerve-centre makes it vulnerable to repeated attacks . ` The high population density , and its intense business and economic activity , make it an easy target for those who want to create worldwide panic , ' he said . ` Terrorists want to demonstrate that despite efforts to prevent such incidents they can still strike at will . Mumbai offers anonymity . It is difficult to identify someone next to you , ' he added . Former union home secretary Ram Pradhan , who headed the 26/11 probe committee , said Mumbai has always been a target because it is here that the maximum damage can be done . ` It 's a big city and such blasts hit the morale of the people , ' he said .",
