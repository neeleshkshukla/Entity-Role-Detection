    "content": "At least two persons were killed and 25 injured in a bomb explosion inside the Lahore railway station on Tuesday evening . The bomb was apparently placed in a bag left at the waiting area for the recently launched luxury train , Business Express . The blast took place around 7 p.m. on Platform No. 2 of the railway station . Given the tight security arrangements at the railway station , the biggest concern of the authorities was how the bomber managed to get the explosives past the various levels of screening in and around the premises . According to the police , about five kg of explosives had been packed into the bag . No organisation had claimed responsibility for the blast till at least two hours after the blast . Bomber evades heavy security . OPEN",
