The State , in the statement , said that Maudany had spoken to several other accused and that it had telephone records to support this . It said Maudany was in touch with accused No 1 ( A1 ) T. Naseer , Edapan Thodika ( A2 ) , Thodika Sharafu ( A4 ) , Manaf ( A6 ) , Mujeeb ( A7 ) , Mohammad Sakaraya ( A8 ) , Faizal ( A10 ) , Abdul Rehaman Aftab ( A14 ) and Umer Farooq ( A16 ) . The statement says that these accused apart from others conspired to set off eight bombs in Bangalore . It said Sharafu had made the microchips that were used in the bombs that went off in Bangalore . Maudany , it said , had attended Jihad camps held by some of the accused in Hosathota in Kodagu . It said that it had evidence that Maudany had discussed the blasts before the bombs were set off in Bangalore . The accused , it said , held meetings in Thayyil Kannur , Aluva , Perambavoor , Chettipady and at Madhapur to conspire to wage war against the State . The statement urged the court not to grant bail to Maudany , saying that it would be difficult to get him back once he is released . Advocate-General Ashok Haranahalli , appearing for the State , sought time to address arguments . Justice V. Jagannathan adjourned further hearing of the case . State files statement of objections Maudany has filed bail petition OPEN",
