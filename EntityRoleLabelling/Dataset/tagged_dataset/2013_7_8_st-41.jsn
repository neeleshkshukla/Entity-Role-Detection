    "content": "The Delhi Police Special Cell had , on the basis of revelations made by alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorist Sayed Maqbool , last October disclosed that the banned outfit planned to target the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya . The police had shared the input with the agencies concerned almost nine months ago . Through an October 26 , 2012 release , the Special Cell announced Maqbools arrest in the Pune blasts case . It said he was a trainer in improvised explosive devices . He was tracked down to Hyderabad where he was arrested on October 23 last year . Based on the purported disclosures of other suspected IM members Asad Khan , Imran Khan , Sayed Feroz and Landge Irfan Mustafa the police had said the four , along with Maqbool , had planned to carry out a fidayeen attack at the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya in retaliation to the alleged atrocities being committed on Muslims in Myanmar . Their plan had the approval and support of Bhatkal brothers -LSB- alleged IM founders -RSB- . The Special Cell said Maqbool had taught Imran and Asad how to configure a bomb . In April 2012 , Imran introduced him to the Bhatkal brothers . Before the Pune serial blasts in August last , Maqbool , Irfan , Imran and Asad discussed their plan to target the Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya , said the release , adding that since the Bhatkals wanted to avenge the death of Qateel Siddiqui ( a terror suspect killed in Punes Yerawada Jail ) , they decided to first carry out blasts in Pune . The police said Maqbool last year helped Imran in conducting a reconnaissance of Dilkushnagar , Begum Bazar and Abids in Hyderabad on a motorcycle . Incidentally , two blasts were triggered that claimed 18 lives in Dilkushnagar on February 21 . No arrests have been made in the case so far . Special Cell had warned in October that IM plans fidayeen attack at Buddhist shrines in Bodh Gaya OPEN",
