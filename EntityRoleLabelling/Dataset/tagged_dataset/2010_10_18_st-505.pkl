S"Police has announced a reward of Rs .15,000 on the head of absconding Samajwadi Party MLA Vijay Mishra , who has been accused of being involved in the bomb attack on an Uttar Pradesh minister earlier this year . The reward has been announced by Inspector General of Police , Allahabad Range , Subesh Kumar Singh , following allegations of Mishra 's involvement in the bomb explosion outside the house of Minister Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi here on July 12 , a police spokesman said on Sunday . The announcement of the reward comes close on the heels of the arrest of Rajesh Pilot , the prime accused in the bomb attack case , who was caught by a team of UP police in Mumbai and brought here last week . Pilot has alleged that he had carried out the explosion at the behest of the SP MLA who had also given him shelter after the blast . Signficantly , Mishra is also a close relative of Dilip Mishra , who had been named in the FIR lodged by Nandi 's relatives following the bomb explosion . Police suspect political and business rivalry to be behind the bomb attack that had killed two persons and seriously injured the minister . While Dilip Mishra is in jail in connection with another criminal case , Vijay Mishra has been absconding ever since his name was involved in a firing incident at an election rally during Lok Sabha polls last year . Nandi was the Minister for Institutional Finance and Stamp and Judicial Fees in the Mayawati Cabinet . After being injured in the attack , he has been recuperating at Lucknow and though his portfolios have been handed over to another senior member of the State Cabinet , Nandi continues to enjoy the status of a minister . PTI Police announces reward of Rs .15,000 Former Mayawati Cabinet Minister recuperating in Lucknow OPEN"
