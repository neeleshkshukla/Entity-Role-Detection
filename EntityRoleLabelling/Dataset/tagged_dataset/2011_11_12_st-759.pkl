S"A landmine was discovered at Jhargram in Paschim Medinipur district in the course of joint security operations against the Maoists on Friday . The development came just one day ahead of a Trinamool Congress rally to be addressed by Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari where he is expected to speak out against Left-Wing extremist activity in the region . A landmine was discovered near Kalabani village . Experts from the Bomb Disposal Squad immediately neutralised it by blasting it , Jhargram Superintendent of Police Gaurav Sharma told The Hindu over telephone . Less than a kilometre away , some landmines had been detected and diffused by the police on Thursday . These landmines were recovered just about seven to eight kilometres away from the site where the Trinamool Congress rally is to be held , Mr. Sharma said . He added that elaborate security arrangements have been put in place ahead of Saturday 's rally . Earlier this month also , suspected Maoists opened fire at a procession of the anti-Maoist political outfit , Jana Jagaran Manch , which is backed by the Trinamool Congress in Paschim Medinipur district on November 6 . The activists of the Jana Jagaran Manch were out on motorcycles asking people to attend the rally . OPEN"
