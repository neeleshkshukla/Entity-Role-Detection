    "content": "A day after a bomb blast outside the Delhi High Court claimed 13 lives and injured over 75 people , investigators on Thursday failed to get definite leads . But a new e-mail , reportedly by the Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) , claimed that it was behind the incident and not the Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami and dared the security agencies to prevent another explosion planned by it at a shopping complex next week . Reward announced Police have detained five persons in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir and one in Uttar Pradesh in connection with the blast . The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has announced a reward of Rs . 5 lakh to anyone providing clues about the explosion . Secretary ( Internal Security ) in the Home Ministry U.K. Bansal said teams of Anti-Terror Squads from the neighbouring States were coming here for consultations with the NIA and the Delhi Police to help in the probe . Forensic science experts from Gandhinagar and Hyderabad scanned the blast site on Thursday and the NIA was vigorously pursuing various leads and looking at all possible connections . On the new e-mail , Mr. Bansal said the investigators were examining it to determine its authenticity . The first e-mail , sent by Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami , was traced to the Global Cyber Caf in Kishtwar district . Its owner and four others were being questioned by police . The person detained in Balrampur in U.P. , resembled one of the sketches released by the Delhi Police and his identity and antecedents were being verified , well placed sources said.Intelligence experts said the latest claim by IM could be a ploy to perplex the investigators and turn out to be a prank . The IM claimed that the HuJI had no role in the blast . Earlier in the day , Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram presided over a meeting of the chiefs of the Research and Analysis Wing ( R&AW ) , Intelligence Bureau and the NIA and reviewed the security scenario . The Home Ministry has entrusted the probe into the May 25 blast in the Delhi High Court to the NIA . Bomb blasts in the recent past in Delhi , which occurred outside the Jama Masjid and in Mehrauli , remain unsolved till date . OPEN",
