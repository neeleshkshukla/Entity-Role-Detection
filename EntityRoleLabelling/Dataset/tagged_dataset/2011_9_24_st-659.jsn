    "content": "The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) got custody of Delhi High Court blast accused Kishtwar resident Amir Abbas Dev until October 7 from a Special Court here on Friday . Dev was sent to a day 's judicial custody at Tihar Central Jail on Thursday after he requested Special Judge ( NIA ) H. S. Sharma for the services of a lawyer to represent him . He was represented by advocate Ravi Kazi on Friday . Like Thursday , Dev was produced under heavy security and with a towel wrapped around his face . The judge allowed only the NIA investigation team , the prosecutor , the accused and Mr. Kazi to be present in court during the remand hearing . On Thursday , the court remanded another accused Abid Hussain in NIA custody until October 5 . Stepping out of the courtroom after the hearing , Mr. Kazi told journalists that Dev was named by Hussain in the conspiracy and that Hussain was named by a person named Shaukat after the NIA tracked them to Kishtwar by tracing an e-mail sent allegedly by them to media houses claiming responsibility for the blast on behalf of banned terror outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami ( HuJI ) . In the remand application , the NIA alleged that Dev was one of the terrorists who had conducted the bomb blast between gate number 4 and 5 of the Delhi High Court . The application also stated that he was one of the conspirators and needed to be interrogated thoroughly to trace his complicity in the terror crime and that of other associates who are also involved in this terrorist crime and conspiracy .
