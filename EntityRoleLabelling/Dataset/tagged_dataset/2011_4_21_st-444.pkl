S'A country-made bomb exploded at a bus stop at Poocherikunnu near Kadalundy on the outskirts of the city early on Wednesday . No casualties have been reported in the incident that occurred at around 5.30 a.m. . The tiles of a waiting shed were destroyed in the explosion . Local people said they heard a big sound and tremors were felt at a nearby house . The police recovered fragmented pieces of steel , nails , paper pieces and jute twines from the site . Low-intensity explosion The explosion was of low intensity . Clues obtained suggested that the bomb was homemade , Anup Kuruvilla John , Commissioner of Police , Kozhikode city , said . Forensic experts collected samples from the debris and sent it for chemical examination at the Forensic Science Laboratory in Thiruvananthapuram . The Feroke police registered a case . A bomb detection and disposal squad and a dog squad checked the area . Assistant Commissioner of Police ( South ) K. Mohanachandran visited the spot . Kadalundy and its adjoining areas are usually conflict-free zones . However , two years ago a similar explosion had occurred at the bus stop . Later , explosive devices were recovered from a cable chamber of the Telecom Department at Athanvalavil , a nearby place . A week before the Assembly elections , the police had recovered four old swords from Mannur near Kadalundy . Heightened political activity and activities of fundamentalist outfits in the region in recent times had created suspicion among the residents . The police think that miscreants could have set off the blast as a test at an unoccupied bus stop or to create panic . OPEN'
