    "content": "Armed police personnel stormed into a hideout at Batlagundu in Dindigul district early on Monday and apprehended Nagoor Hanifa alias Mohamed Hanifa ( 35 ) , one of the prime suspects who allegedly conspired to eliminate Bharatiya Janata Party leader L.K. Advani and attempted to blow up his convoy near Madurai on October 28 , 2011 . Acting on a specific input , plainclothesmen led by Deputy Inspector-General of Police ( Special Investigation Team ) John Nicholson arrested Hanifa , a native of Tenkasi , who was alone in the house . A powerful pipe bomb stuffed with about 7 kg of explosives , mostly nitroglycerine , was detected and defused hours before the convoy of Mr. Advani was to have passed through a culvert at Alampatti in Madurai district . The BJP leader , who is covered by the Z-Plus category of security , was in Tamil Nadu as part of his Jan Chetna Yatra . The pipe was packed with Power Gel 90 , an explosive used to blast rocks in quarries . Timely alert by a passer-by helped the district police foil the conspiracy to blow up the causeway . A long wire connected to the pipe bomb was noticed by a villager who alerted the police . Hanifa is refusing to divulge information regarding his association with any organisation . He seems to be following the Jihadi principles ... he committed the murder of one Kumara Pandian of Hindu Munnani in Tenkasi , Mr. Nicholson told The Hindu . Besides the Babri Masjid issue , he wanted to take revenge for what he says the treatment meted out to Muslims . Hanifa and his associates had planned to take revenge on BJP and Hindu Munnani leaders , he said parrying questions on the details of the hit-list . Mr. Nicholson said three persons Fakruddin alias Police Fakruddin , Bilal Malik and Hanifa were the main conspirators in the plan to blow up the convoy of Mr. Advani . They were present at the scene of crime and escaped on seeing the police . Efforts are on to apprehend the other two . We have so far arrested eight persons in the case . The source of explosives is underinvestigation . Hanifa will be produced in a court and remanded , he added . Detonators and explosive materials and two long knives and a newspaper clipping containing the photograph of a Hindu outfit functionary were recovered from Hanifa , the police said . The SIT has arrested eight persons so far in the case . The pipe was packed with Power Gel 90 , an explosive used to blast rocks in quarriesThe BJP leader was in State as part of his Jan Chetna Yatra The pipe was packed with Power Gel 90 , an explosive used to blast rocks in quarries The BJP leader was in State as part of his Jan Chetna Yatra OPEN",
