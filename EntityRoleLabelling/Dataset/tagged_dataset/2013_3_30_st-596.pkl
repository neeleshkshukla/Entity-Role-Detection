S"Four car bombs struck Shiite mosques during Friday prayers in Baghdad and the disputed northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk , killing at least four people and wounding more than 80 , officials said . The blasts all struck within an hour of each other from around 1:00 pm in the Baghdad neighbourhoods of Jihad , Qahira and Zafraniyah , as well as in an area of south Kirkuk . Several hurt In the deadliest attack , three people were killed and 70 wounded by a car bomb in southern Kirkuk city , near the al-Rasul al-Aadham mosque , according to Sadiq Omar Rasul , chief of the provincial health directorate . The blasts in Baghdad , meanwhile , left at least one dead and 18 wounded , security and medical officials said . Gearing up for polls The attacks come amid a spike in violence nationwide as the country prepares for its first elections in three years - provincial polls that will be held in 12 of Iraq 's 18 provinces on April 20 . Questions have been raised over the credibility of those polls as elections have been postponed in two provinces roiled by months of protests , and at least 11 candidates have been killed , according to an AFP tally . While no group immediately claimed the attacks , Sunni militants linked to Al-Qaeda frequently target Shiite Muslims whom they regard as apostates and supporters of the Shiite-led government in Baghdad . Mounting toll Violence is down from its peak in 2006 and 2007 but attacks remain common - at least 245 people have been killed this month , already more than in February , according to an AFP tally based on reports from security and medical officials.AFP OPEN"
