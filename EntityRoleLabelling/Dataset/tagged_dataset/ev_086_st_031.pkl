VThe Left parties on Thursday strongly condemned the Mumbai serial blasts and rued the governments inability to track down the perpetrators of recent terror strikes . . . It is disturbing that the forces behind the recent bomb blasts in different parts of the country have not been identified and apprehended . No efforts should be spared to track down the culprits of the Mumbai blasts , the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- Polit Bureau said in a statement in New Delhi . . . In the same vein , the Communist Party of India Central Secretariat said this was not the first time that such blasts have taken place . This is clear evidence that the government is unable to trace the perpetrators through its intelligence agencies . Therefore the Centre should take appropriate measures to track down the terrorists . . . Senior CPI leader D. Raja , who visited a blast site and hospitals in Mumbai on Wednesday night , accused Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram of continuously failing at maintaining peace . . . Observing that Mr. Chidambaram was resorting to rhetoric than action , he said though the internal security issue has been debated many times in Parliament , no decision to strengthen the security apparatus seems to have been implemented . Security agencies might have slackened their alertness . If lapses are found , action should be taken to plug the loopholes . . . Mr. Raja also criticised Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi for his reported statement that 99 per cent of terror attacks have been thwarted . . . Such casual and callous remarks should not be made . One should be more serious while commenting on such sensitive incidents , he said , adding that Mr. Gandhis comments on the U.S. and Afghanistan raises questions as to whether he knows what he is talking about .
