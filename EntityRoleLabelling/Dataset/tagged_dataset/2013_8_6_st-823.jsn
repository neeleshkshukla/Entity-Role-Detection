    "content": "Police and government officials on Monday condemned an attack on a Buddhist temple in Indonesias capital after a small bomb detonated as devotees inside prayed , injuring one person . Two other devices failed to go off . The explosion happened Sunday night at the Ekayana Grha Buddhist temple in West Jakarta . The blast went off near the front door of the building , slightly damaging the structure , chief of National Police Detective Lt. Gen. Sutarman told reporters at the scene . Another bomb placed near the back door emitted smoke , but did not go off and a third device placed inside the temple also failed to go off , added Sutarman , who like many Indonesians , uses a single name . Police were investigating . Now , the terrorists may have shifted their target from ( Christian ) churches to ( Buddhist ) temples , Sutarman said . This is possibly triggered by the sectarian conflict in Myanmar . Muslim militants in Indonesia angered over sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar have threatened to attack Buddhist temples here . In May , two men were arrested with low explosives in a backpack as part of an alleged plot to bomb the Myanmar Embassy in Jakarta . The incident occurred days ahead of festivities planned to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan . Indonesia is the worlds most populous Muslim nation , and most people practice a moderate form of the religion.AP OPEN",
