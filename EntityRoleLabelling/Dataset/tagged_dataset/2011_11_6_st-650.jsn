    "content": "Bomb and gun attacks targeting police stations and churches in the northeastern Nigerian city of Damaturu left 63 people dead , said a Red Cross official on Saturday . One of the police buildings was hit by a suicide bomber , Suleimon Lawal , police chief for Yobe state , whose capital is Damaturu , told AFP . A local government official said hundreds were also injured when the attackers bombed a city police headquarters , three other police stations and six churches in Damaturu late Friday , after similar raids in another city blamed on an Islamist sect . A lawyer who visited Damaturu 's government hospital Saturday looking for a missing friend said he counted 60 bodies in the morgue , all brought in yesterday from the attacks . The lawyer , who asked not to be named , told AFP he found the friend , a policeman , among the corpses . No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks , but residents of Damaturu blame the Islamist sect Boko Haram , based in nearby Maiduguri , where a suicide blast earlier Friday damaged a military headquarters . An official told AFP that the hospital was full to the brim with wounded . AFP OPEN",
