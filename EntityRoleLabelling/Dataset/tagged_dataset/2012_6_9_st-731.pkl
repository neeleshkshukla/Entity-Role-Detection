S"At least 19 people were killed and nearly 50 injured when a powerful bomb ripped through a bus ferrying government employees and civilians in Peshawar on Friday morning . No outfit had claimed responsibility till late evening but this is the second day in a row that terrorists have struck in the north western parts of the country with sizable number of casualties . Over the past 36 hours , 35 people have been killed in the two separate blasts the other being at a religious seminary in Quetta where 14 people were killed on Thursday . Though there have been sporadic terror strikes in the past few months , these two blasts have raised the spectre of a fresh onslaught by terrorists . The bus heading from Peshawar to Charsadda was completely damaged by the explosion a stark testimony about how powerful the bomb was . Apparently eight kg of explosives had been packed into the bus . The dead included seven women and a child , and doctors at the Lady Reading Hospital feared more casualties as some of the injured were brought in a critical condition . Briefing media-persons , Khyber-Pukhtoonkhwa 's Information Minister Iftikhar Hussain whose only son was gunned down by terrorists said the fight against terrorism would continue despite such setbacks .
