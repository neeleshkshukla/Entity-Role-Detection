S'It was a lucky escape for Hema Chandrashekhar , who lives with her family on the first floor of the building in front of which an improvised explosive device ( IED ) went off at Malleswaram on Wednesday morning . The impact of the blast blew doors from their hinges , one of them landing on the furniture . The window glass was reduced to smithereens . Amazingly , Ms. Chandrashekhar escaped without a single scratch . I was actually watching TV in the hall and was sitting very close to the doors . But just a few moments after I got up from there , I heard a loud blast and saw flames . It was providence that I moved away at the right time . Door jams shut However , her son found himself stuck in his room as the impact jammed the door shut . We had to use a screwdriver to lever the lock and get him out , Ms. Chandrashekhar said . Soon after the blast , the area witnessed a power outage . We initially thought it was an electrical problem because we saw flames near the electrical wire . We were then told that it was a bomb blast , she said . The blast has left Indira , a resident of the ground floor of the building , thoroughly shaken . I was sitting near the kitchen window around 10.30 a.m. when shock wave resulted in violent rattling of window panes . I saw glass shards strewn around the house , especially at the entrance . Shocked elder Nursing his injured ankle , Guruva Reddy ( 82 ) , who lives down the road , sat in a corner trying to collect himself . He was putting on his shirt at his home when the explosion ripped through , shattering window panes , and the pieces piercing his ankle . A still shocked Mr. Reddy said : I am just glad I dont suffer from blood pressure or diabetes . It would have been very difficult to cope with such injuries . A few metres away from where he sat , hundreds of people , including police personnel and a large media contingent , jammed the area . Malleswaram 11th Cross was carpeted with shattered glass , mostly from the broken window shields of parked vehicles . I OPEN'
