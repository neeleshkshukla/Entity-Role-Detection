According to NIA , Tariqul Islam carries a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head and NIA was looking for him after October 2014 Bardhaman blast . Around 30-year-old Tariqul Islam is a Bangladesh national and lived at Barharwa in Sahebganj district . He was hiding in Ramgarh district after police mounted a search operation for him in Sahebganj . Sahebganj is situated on the tri-junction of Jharkhand-West Bengal and Bangladesh . Several terrorists have been arrested in connection with Bardhaman blast in Jharkhand . Police spokesperson SN Pradhan said he was wanted as a proclaimed warrantee in the Bardhaman blast case . `` The information was given to ATS recently by NIA . ATS developed the information and tracked him down . A team of NIA came to coordinate the operation which resulted into the arrest , '' Pradhan said . In October 2014 an explosion took place in a house at Bardhaman revealing the hideout of the JMB . In subsequent raids police had found several IEDs , and explosive substance from the house . `` He is one of the top terrorist of JMB and handled its Jharkhand structure . He is a bigger catch than what we had initially thought , '' Pradhan said . ATS has been newly formed in Jharkhand and Pradhan said it was the first major success of the anti terrorist squad . NIA is likely to produce him in the local court on Wednesday to seek his transit remand . OPEN",
