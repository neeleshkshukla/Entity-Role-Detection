Investigators recovered ball bearings and pellets , besides traces of ammonium nitrate , nitro toluene and sulphur from the blast sites . Preliminary investigation indicated that four men carrying two cloth bags had boarded S4 and S5 as soon as the train arrived . Surveillance cameras have captured the visuals of them coming out empty-handed . We strongly believe they had left those bags under the seats in the two coaches and triggered the blasts from outside . We are examining what their motives could have been , a senior police officer said , adding that three men have been detained for questioning . . . Chief minister J Jayalalithaa in a statement assured the people there was no need to panic as security measures had been tightened . She ordered state crime branch CID police to probe the incident .",
