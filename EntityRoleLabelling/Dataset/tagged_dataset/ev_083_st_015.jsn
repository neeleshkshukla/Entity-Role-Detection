    "content": "The Mumbai attacks drew widespread international condemnation as cowardly acts of terrorism . But beneath the stock responses was an undercurrent of anxiety that the atrocity could aggravate latent tensions between India and Pakistan . . . George Bush offered his condolences to the Indian people as the White House convened a meeting of top intelligence and counter-terrorism officials . President-elect Barack Obama was briefed by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and said in a statement : `` These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism . The US must continue to strengthen partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks . '' . . In Moscow President Dmitry Medvedev said : `` We are concerned about the loss of life and consider acts of terrorism of this type are harmful to the whole international order and a challenge to humanity . '' . . The Pope and the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon both deplored the violence . . . Gordon Brown said : `` I think I speak for the whole world - shocked and outraged at the tragic destruction of innocent lives . I have already sent my sympathy and support to prime minister [ Manhoman ) Singh . We will do everything we can to help the Indian government . '' . . David Miliband , the foreign secretary , condemned `` a callous inhuman and indiscriminate attack on people of all races and all religions '' . He said : `` This is an attack on all of us because democracy in India is vibrant and because Mumbai is one of the world 's most diverse cities . '' . . Comments by prime minister Singh blaming the attacks on a terrorist group with `` external linkages '' rang alarm bells that echoed the dark days of India-Pakistan relations when India routinely saw a Pakistan hand in militant attacks , blaming groups it claimed were set up by Pakistan 's spy agency , the Inter-Services Intelligence , or ISI , to avenge Pakistan 's defeat by India in the 1971 war . . . A terrorist attack on India 's parliament in December 2001 triggered a mass mobilisation along the two countries ' borders and brought them close to a fourth war . That incident was blamed by India on Pakistan-based Kashmiri militant groups . . . Pakistan 's government strongly condemned the violence and expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life . Pakistan 's foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who arrived in India on Wednesday , condemned the attacks but warned against jumping to any conclusions about the background to them . . . Miliband paid tribute to Singh , saying : `` I believe that the comments and leadership of prime minister Singh show that he is a man also of great statesmanship and great determination to build links between India and Pakistan .
