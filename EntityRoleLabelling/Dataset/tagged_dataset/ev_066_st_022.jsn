NEW DELHI : Although no evidence has so far emerged on the involvement of any particular outfit in the Samjhauta Express blasts , investigations are on to find out if an Uttar Pradesh-based module carried out the blasts . . . The forensic team examining the suitcase containing an unexploded bomb that was recovered from the railway tracks near the blasts site , found a mixture of chemicals wrapped in a piece of newspaper . The torn page of the newspaper dated January 11 , 2006 , belongs to a western Uttar Pradesh edition of a renowned Hindi daily . It carries an article by a news agency about the recovery of 114 live grenades from inside the Golden Temple . . . Initial enquiries have indicated that it could be the Agra or nearby Aligarh edition of the newspaper . . . ` It raises doubts about the role of an outfit like SIMI . However , at the initial stage of investigations we can not concentrate on just one organisation , ' said a police officer . . . A police source said that no arrests had been made in the case so far . . . However , some persons were questioned in Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Delhi in connection with the blasts , the source said .",
