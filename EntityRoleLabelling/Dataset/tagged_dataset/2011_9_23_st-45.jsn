    "content": "The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) told a special court here on Thursday that Amir Abbas Dev , a resident of Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir , was one of the terrorists involved in the blast outside the Delhi High Court on September 7 that killed 15 people and injured many . Dev was produced in the court in the afternoon and remanded to a day in judicial custody after he requested that he be represented by a lawyer . Earlier in the morning , the NIA produced another accused , Abid Hussain , before the court and it remanded him in the agency 's custody until October 5 . In its remand application that sought police custody of Dev , the NIA said Dev was one of the terrorists who had conducted the bomb blast between Gate No. 4 and 5 of the Delhi High Court . The application also stated that he was one of the conspirators and needed to be interrogated thoroughly to trace his complicity in the crime and that of other associates who are also involved in this terrorist crime and conspiracy . The NIA had sought in-camera proceedings after which Special Judge ( NIA ) H. S. Sharma asked journalists to vacate the courtroom . Only those persons will stand in the court whom I will allow . Please vacate the court , he said . Hussain and Dev were brought to Delhi on Wednesday following their arrest at Kishtwar . They had allegedly sent emails to media houses claiming responsibility for the blast on behalf of the Harkat ul-Jihad al-Islami . The two were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code , the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , and the Explosive Substances Act , dealing with criminal conspiracy , murder , attempt to murder , causing grievous hurt , and using explosives . Another accused , Shariq Ahmed , is yet to be produced in court . OPEN",
