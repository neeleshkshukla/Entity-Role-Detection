S'Jagtar Singh Hawara of the Babbar Khalsa International on Thursday pleaded guilty in a court here along with four others of playing various roles in the 2005 twin blasts at Satyam and Liberty cinema . Hawara , was the chief conspirator in former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singhs assassination . After the five admitted their guilt , Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Siddhartha convicted them and sentenced them to the time in prison they had spent in judicial custody during the trial in the twin blast case . The four others convicts are BKI members Balwinder Singh , Jaspal Singh , Vikas Sehgal and Jagannath Yadav . They have been in custody since May 31 , 2005 . Last year , four other accused in the case had pleaded guilty , and were subsequently convicted and released . While they will be released , Hawara , who is serving a life term for assassinating former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh , is also on trial for allegedly firing at police personnel when they tried to apprehend him . He was initially awarded a death penalty for the assassination which was commuted later to a life term by the Chandigarh High Court . In the blasts case , Hawara was charged for harbouring Jaspal and Vikas , who were actively involved in executing the blasts . A fine of Rs .25,000 was also imposed on each of them . Sixty persons were injured in the blasts on May 22 , 2005 , in which bombs were triggered by crude devices during the screening of the controversial Hindi film Jo Bole So Nihaal .

The four men apart from Hawara pleaded guilty of conspiracy to commit offences against the State , attempt to murder , and culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the Indian Penal Code . Sentenced to jail term already undergone OPEN'
