S"Suicide bombers hit two security service bases in Damascus on Friday , killing 40 people and casting a pall over the first day of work of an Arab observer mission intended to oversee an end to nine months of bloodshed . The bombings , which officials blamed on al-Qaeda , were the first against the powerful security services in the heart of the capital since the uprising began and overshadowed protests against President Bashar al-Assad 's regime . The new toll for the two attacks today is established at 40 dead and 150 injured , an official told AFP . Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah , an ally of Mr. Assad , accused terrorist Washington of orchestrating the attacks . The movement said such bombings are the speciality of the United States , which is seeking revenge for its defeat in Iraq , days after its forces completed their withdrawal from the country . Lebanese President Michel Sleiman condemned the blasts as terrorist attacks and said they were aimed at disrupting the Arab League 's efforts to resolve the crisis . The observer mission is part of an Arab plan endorsed by Syria on November 2 that also calls for the withdrawal of the military from towns and a halt to violence against civilians . AFP OPEN"
