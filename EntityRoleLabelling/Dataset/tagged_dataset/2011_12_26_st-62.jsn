    "content": "Two persons , including a teenage boy and a newly recruited cadet officer of the Central Reserve Police Force , died in a freak accident near a CRPF camp at Mudkhed in Nanded district in Maharashtra on Sunday when a High Explosive Bomb exploded accidentally . A local woman who had gone to pick metal pieces from the CRPF firing range had picked up an unexploded bomb , which she threw , in fear , towards the CRPF cadet officers on being apprehended by them . The explosion wounded seven persons , including the local woman . One of the injured teenage boys is in critical condition , police said . A 12-year-old boy died on the spot while the cadet officer succumbed to his injuries when he was being treated at the hospital . Of the seven others injured in the blast , the condition of one is serious , Shahaji Umap , Additional Superintendent of Police , Nanded , told The Hindu . The blast happened at around 2 p.m. , he said . Mr. Umap said the CRPF had a training institute and a firing range around 15 km away from Mudkhed , where CRPF jawans and officers conduct regular firing practice . The children of the village around the area enter the firing range to collect metal pieces that are found in the range due to the firing and shelling practice . The villagers later sell the metal pieces as scrap to earn money , Mr. Umap said . There are times when some bombs which are fired with the help of bomb-launchers do not explode and keep lying there , he said . OPEN",
