NEW DELHI : Explosions triggered by crude devices rocked two cinema halls here on Sunday evening during the screening of the controversial Hindi film , ` Jo Bole So Nihal , ' leaving one person dead and at least 60 injured . . . Following the blasts , a red alert was sounded in the capital . While the first explosion occurred at Liberty Cinema on the busy G. T. Karnal Road around 8.15 p.m. , the second one went off at Satyam Cinema in Patel Nagar 20 minutes later . One of those injured died at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital later , while the condition of 10 others was reported to be serious . . . Stampede . . In the first incident at Liberty Cinema , the explosive device was reportedly planted under a seat in the sixth row . The explosion , which ripped apart the seats and parts of the false ceiling , also touched off a stampede with people running helter-skelter in panic . Some of the injured were immediately rushed to a nearby private nursing home , while others were taken to the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya , the Hindu Rao , the Lohia and the Lady Hardinge Hospitals . . . The second bomb went off in the toilet of Satyam Cinema , injuring at least 10 persons and triggering off a commotion in the cinema hall . Most of the injured were rushed to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital . . . Soon after the explosions , there was chaos outside both cinema halls as the police cordoned off the area to carry out search operations . Relatives of those who had come to watch the movie frantically searched for their near and dear ones as no information was forthcoming . Some were in tears as they rushed from one hospital to the other in search of their family members and relatives . . . Among the first to visit Liberty Cinema were the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi , B.L. Joshi , the Delhi Chief Minister , Sheila Dikshit , and the Delhi Police Commissioner , K.K. Paul . Ms. Dikshit expressed serious concern over the law and order situation in the capital . The Lieutenant-Governor ordered an inquiry into the blasts .
