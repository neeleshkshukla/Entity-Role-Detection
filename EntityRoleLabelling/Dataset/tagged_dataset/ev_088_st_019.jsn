Whether it was a terrorist act or not will be determined only after proper investigations are carried out by Maharashtra ATS , city crime branch and central agencies , Patil said . . . Agencies . . Four coordinated low-intensity explosions struck the busy arterial Jangli Maharaj ( JM ) road in the heart of Pune on Wednesday . The explosions occurred near Balgandharva Theatre , Dena Bank branch , a McDonald food outlet and Garware Bridge . . . Asked whether there could be a saffron terror angle to the incident , he said , All angles are being probed and it will not be proper to comment at this stage . . . He said the person injured in one of the blasts near Balgandharva theatre was being treated for minor injuries . . . The injured person Dayanand Patil , who hails from a nearby village of Uruli Kanchan , had reportedly visited the spot opposite the Balgandharva Theatre , where a dharna agitation by India Against Corruption was in progress . . . After he left the place , the explosive , which had apparently been put in his carry bag , exploded on the way , police sources said . . . Unconfirmed reports said ammonium nitrate could have been the substance used in the blast triggered by small detonators and pencil cells . . . Police have also issued an advisory to IAC activists to wind up the dharna pandal for security reasons . . . Life in the city returned to normal late night as the blasts did not cause any large-scale damage . Police have appealed to people to ignore rumours and carry on daily routine without fear .",
