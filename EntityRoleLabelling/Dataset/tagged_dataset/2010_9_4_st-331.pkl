S"A woman was injured seriously in a blast in her house at Bhatkal on Thursday night . The police made no breakthrough in their investigation till Friday evening . The injured woman has been identified as Julekha ( 48 ) . She could not give any details as she is speech impaired . The blast took place in Julekha 's house at Mugalihonda ( Puravarga ) in Bhatkal . Julekha 's neighbours said that they heard a deafening sound around 9.30 p.m. . They rushed to Julekha 's house after they heard her screaming . Julekha was shifted to hospital immediately . Julekha 's younger sister , who stays near her house , said she had no idea how the blast occurred . Julekha 's daughter lives in Goa . Julekha 's son , who lives in Dubai , arrived in Bangalore a few days ago , it is said . He met his mother in the hospital on Friday . He informed the police that his mother told him in sign language that the explosion took place when she tried to light a lamp . Vedamurthy , Deputy Superintendent of Police , told The Hindu that the police could not make much headway in the investigation because Julekha was speech impaired . He said that a bomb disposal squad and a dog squad had been sent to the blast site from Karwar . Ballistic experts from Bangalore would visit the house soon . Mr. Vedamurthy said that Julekha , who was being treated in a hospital in Kundapur , would be shifted to the medical college in Manipal . OPEN"
