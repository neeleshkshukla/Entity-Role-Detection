    "content": "The trial in the Kozhikode twin bomb blasts cases began in camera before a National Investigation Agency special court here on Monday . The court ordered in-camera trial on a request from the NIA prosecutor . Two policemen and a porter were injured in the blasts on March 3 , 2006 . The explosions took place at a garbage dump in the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot and near the moffusil bus stand on Mavoor Road within 10 minutes of each other . The charge sheet said some of the accused involved in the 2004 Marad case were denied bail by the Kozhikode district court . They , therefore , hatched a conspiracy and planted bombs in order to retaliate and create communal disharmony between two communities . As many as seven accused are facing trial in the case . One accused had earlier been killed in an encounter with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir while crossing the India-Pakistan boarder for getting arms training in Pakistan . Two others were declared as proclaimed offenders as they went into hiding . The charge sheet said some of these accused were also involved in several anti-national and terror-related cases . Earlier , the cases were investigated by the Kozhikode city police and the Crime Branch CID Kozhikode . Taking into consideration the gravity of the incident and its terror angle , the Central government had directed the NIA to take up the investigation . OPEN",
