Nazir , prime accused in the case , was taken to difference places after he was brought here from Kozhikode around noon by the NIA team headed by Superintendent of Police T.K. Rajmohan . The police escorted him to the places as a sequel to the evidence collection exercise completed in Kozhikode on Tuesday . According to the investigators , Nazir and his associates had hatched the conspiracy for the twin blasts in Kannur . After interrogating him at the Police Club here , Nazir was taken to a room at Anakkulam where the bombs used for the blasts had been made , Maidanappally and Payyambalam where the bombs had been tested , a madrassa at Chalad where the explosive devices had been allegedly kept and a shop from where some of the materials for making the devices had been purchased . It was the second time Nazir , who is hailing from here and is believed to have connections with LeT and the Indian Mujahideen , was brought here for evidence gathering in a terror-related case . Earlier in December last , the Bangalore police had taken him to different places here to unearth evidence in the Bangalore blasts case . Nazir and his associate Shafas Shamsuddin had been handed over to the Bangalore police after their arrest from the Bangladesh border . They have now been transferred to the custody of the NIA for the probe in the Kozhikode blasts case . OPEN",
