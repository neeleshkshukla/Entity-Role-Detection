VChennai : A young woman techie was killed and 14 other passengers sustained bleeding injuries when two bombs , suspected to be IEDs with timers , went off in quick succession in adjacent compartments of Bengaluru-Guwahati express train Thursday morning . The blasts happened at about 7.14 in S4 and S5 coaches , within five minutes of the train arriving here from Bengaluru . The impact caused some damage to S3 as well . . . The deceased , Swati , 24 , worked for software major TCS at Bengaluru and was on her way home at Guntur in Andhra Pradesh . Her grieving parents rushed here and took the body to the native place by a government ambulance . She was to be married in two months . The injured , including a woman , were admitted in the Rajiv Gandhi memorial government general hospital across the road . All of them are stable , according to the doctors . They said most of the injured had pellet wounds and two suffered multiple fractures on legs . ( Read : Chennai blast kills Andhra Pradesh techie ; 14 hurt ) . . Investigators recovered ball bearings and pellets , besides traces of ammonium nitrate , nitro toluene and sulphur from the blast sites . Preliminary investigation indicated that four men carrying two cloth bags had boarded S4 and S5 as soon as the train arrived . Surveillance cameras have captured the visuals of them coming out empty-handed . We strongly believe they had left those bags under the seats in the two coaches and triggered the blasts from outside . We are examining what their motives could have been , a senior police officer said , adding that three men have been detained for questioning . . . Chief minister J Jayalalithaa in a statement assured the people there was no need to panic as security measures had been tightened . She ordered state crime branch CID police to probe the incident .
