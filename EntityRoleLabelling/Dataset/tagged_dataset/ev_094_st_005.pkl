VFive persons were killed and 83 injured in multiple blasts that rocked Patnas Gandhi Maidan and the railway station on Sunday , hours before BJPs prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address the Hunkar rally here . . . A rash of seven explosions ripped through the surroundings of the Gandhi Maidan , where nearly over two lakh people had gathered for the rally . Of the 83 people injured , two are in a critical condition . . . A total of seven blasts took place of which five were inside the Gandhi Maidan and two at the station , Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj told The Hindu . . . One of the blasts at the station occurred even as the bomb disposal squad was defusing a bomb . The police found two unexploded improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- at two locations around the maidan . Searches are on for more IEDs . . . The blasts claimed the lives of Ram Narayan Singh , Vikas Singh , Munna Srivastav and two others . . . The first blast occurred at 9.30 a.m. in the toilet on Platform 10 at the Patna junction . One critically injured person , admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna , is believed to be a suspect . . . There is a possibility that he was injured while planting the bomb , Director-General of Police Abhayanand told a press conference . . . Two hours later , the second blast took place around 11.40 a.m. on the Gandhi Maidan near Udyog Bhavan . The third one occurred at 12.05 p.m. near the Regent Cinema Hall , the fourth at 12.15 p.m. near the twin towers , and the fifth at 12.20 p.m. near the State Bank of India office . The last blast went off near the childrens park , the DGP said . . . There is discrepancy in the number and location of blasts given by the police . While the SSP said there were two blasts at the railway station , the DGP said there was only one . While the SSP said five blasts occurred inside the maidan , the DGP said only one went off . . . I was defusing a bomb when it went off , Navin Kumar Sah , member of the bomb disposal squad , who was injured , told The Hindu at the Patna Medical College and Hospital . The second blast took place at 1 p.m. I could escape with a fractured finger . The bomb I was defusing had a timer attached to it . So it could not have been a crude bomb , he said . . . The police had arrested one Imtiaz Ansari , who was allegedly trying to flee after the blast at the station . He is suspected to be a member of the Indian Mujahideen and has given his confession . Three others detained also confessed to the crime , according to the police . . . IEDs were used in all the blasts , and timers and improvised switches were used in some . The bomb planted at the station was complicated , Mr. Abhayanand said . . . Asked if there was a terror link , Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the possibility could not be ruled out . However , he denied political conspiracy . At a press conference , he condemned the incident and denied any security lapse by the police or the administration . The attacks were carried out with an intention to vitiate the atmosphere in Bihar . They took us completely by surprise . We had no intelligence input or alert either from the Centre or State agencies . It would be wrong and an over simplification to call this a security lapse . Such a thing has never happened in Bihar , Mr. Kumar said . . . Bihar has not had a history of confrontation . This is the handiwork of people who want to spoil Bihars climate . We wont let them succeed in their designs . , he said . . . He announced an ex gratia of Rs .5 lakh for the families of the deceased .
