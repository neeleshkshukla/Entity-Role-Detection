S"Even as the hunt is on for a motorcyclist who attached an improvised explosive magnetic device to an Israeli diplomat 's car on Aurangazeb Road here on Monday , the Delhi Police have sought footage of the closed-circuit television cameras in nearby buildings , the Israeli Embassy and the Canadian High Commission . We have sought the footage of the past seven-eight days . As the Canadian High Commission is located close to the spot , we have approached them for footage , Police Commissioner B.K. Gupta said . Police have identified 16 CCTVs installed at bungalows along the road and in nearby areas and their footage are being sought . Police suspect that the terrorist must have conducted a reconnaissance of the area and tailed Tal Yehoshua Koren embassy official and wife of Israel 's defence attach , who was seriously injured in the blast to ascertain her daily routine . Police , however , have not come across any significant grab revealing the assailant 's identity or the motorcycle 's registration number . From an eyewitness account , they believe that the motorcycle 's colour was red . On that basis , they have questioned five persons . Another person has come forward to reveal that he had passed by the Israeli Embassy around the time of the explosion . As described by the eyewitness , the device affixed to the diplomat 's car was not bigger than a palmtop or a brick . The bomb would have exploded in three to five seconds after it was stuck to the vehicle . While escaping , the motorcyclist hit a bollard dividing the road , moved to the other carriageway and apparently took a left turn before speeding away , he said . Police are not yet sure whether the bomb was triggered mechanically or detonated by a remote control device or a timer . But they have found magnet pieces at the spot . Given that such a bomb has been used for the first time in the country , police suspect the involvement of a terror module well trained in handling explosives , and probably having links with international terror organisations . The attacker managed to escape from the spot within seconds and without sustaining any injury , which shows that he was well trained , Mr. Gupta said . Neither the injured Israeli Embassy official nor car driver Manoj Sharma saw the motorcyclist , Mr. Gupta said . Police are yet to record the statement of Ms. Koren , who was going to pick up her children from school when the blast took place . The eyewitness , a resident of Patparganj in East Delhi , was driving a Ford Ikon behind the embassy car . He claimed that he saw the motorcyclist sticking a box-like object at the right rear end of the car seconds before the explosion . As part of investigations , the whereabouts of foreign nationals are being checked by police and intelligence agencies . OPEN"
