VDespite multiple meetings by the police and the administration and intelligence inputs it was regrettable that nearly eight blasts rocked the Mahabodhi temple in Bihars Gaya district . The explosions injured two persons , including a Burmese monk , Pragya Deep , Treasurer of the All India Bhiku Sangha told The Hindu on the phone from Bodh Gaya . . . The administration had prior information . There was a report of the Intelligence Bureau . A series of security review meetings have been conducted . There have been at least five to six meetings . Its shameful that despite this , the blasts have taken place . This is a mistake on the part of the administration , Pragya Deep said . . . He was conducting a meeting in the Sanghas office , about 10 minutes from the Mahabodhi temple , when he heard sounds of the blast . . . We immediately left for the temple , where we were informed by the monks there of the serial explosions . The explosions began around 5.15 a.m. and lasted for half an hour , he said . . . The first blast took place on the left of the sacred Bodhi tree where the Buddhas footprints are located . The second blast site was the candle house where the bomb was kept in an ambulance located outside . The third explosion was outside the Animesh Lochan Chaitya , one of the places associated with enlightenment of Lord Buddha . The Buddha is believed to have stood here for seven days looking at the Bodhi tree , Pragya Deep said . . . The next blast was near a wall railing that is the entry point for the monks . This could have been intended to cause loss of life , but thankfully not many people were there around that time . . . One Burmese monk Vishwavidya was injured in this blast . He sustained injuries in the leg , hand , head and chest . He is being treated at the local government hospital . A staff member of the Nirmal Temple was also injured in the explosion . Both of them are out of danger , Pragya Deep said . . . The next three bombs went off in a car outside the Karma Temple . A final blast was near the famous Japanese Buddha statue . Two bombs were kept near the statue . One went off while one which was placed near the feet did not explode . Had it gone off , the damage would have been great , Pragya Deep said . . . There is a sense of fear among the monks at the temple . Its natural to feel fear . I dont know why the temple was made the target . We were never involved in any kind of violence . Neither is there any ongoing religious conflict involving the Buddhist community , Pragya Deep said .
