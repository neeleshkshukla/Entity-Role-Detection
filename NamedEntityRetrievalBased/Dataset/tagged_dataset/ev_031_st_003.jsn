Though no outfit claimed responsibility for the blast , DIG -LRB- central range -RRB- G P Singh did not rule out the possibility of Ulfa 's involvement in it . Terming the attack as a ` cowardice act ' , chief minister Tarun Gogoi asked security forces to step up counter-insurgency operations in the state . ` The government will deal with these forces -LRB- terrorists -RRB- with a firm hand . I appeal to all to stay united and cooperate with the government , ' he said . Cops said rebels placed a powerful IED in a van that had a logo of Indian Airlines . The explosion took place at 11.50 am at a market at Bamunimaidan . Three LPG cylinders at a shop also exploded due to the impact of the blast , setting fire to several shops in the crowded locality . The deceased was identified by cops as Ram Lal Ram . He was a native of Begusarai in Bihar and had been living in the city for a long time . Later , the driver of the van was detained . Though police identified the van owner , they declined to give details about him .",
