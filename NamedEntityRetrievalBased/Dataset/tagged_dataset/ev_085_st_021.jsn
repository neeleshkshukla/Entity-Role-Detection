The bomb was stashed in a milk container on the Sheetla Ghat , one of many stone staircases leading to the Ganges river , the site of daily spiritual rituals , according to Brij Lal , a police official . . . The explosion set off a stampede , and 19 people , including four foreigners , were wounded , Lal said . It was not immediately clear how many were hurt in the blast and how many in the subsequent chaos . . . A 2-year-old who had been sitting on her mothers lap when the bomb went off died in a hospital , Lal said . Her mother and two others , including one of the foreigners , were in serious condition . . . The force of the explosion ripped away a metal railing and damaged stones up to 200 feet away , said a witness , Ramatama Srivastava . . . Srivastava who spoke by telephone from Varanasi , which is about 180 miles southeast of the Uttar Pradesh state capital of Lucknow said he noticed the foreigners were watching the Hindu prayer ceremony and taking photographs . . . The ceremony is a daily ritual in Varanasi , the holiest city in the Hindu religion , during which priests and others light oil lamps , ring bells , and chant prayers . . . The Press Trust of India reported a Muslim terror group allegedly claimed responsibility for the blast in an e-mail to several media outlets . . . .",
