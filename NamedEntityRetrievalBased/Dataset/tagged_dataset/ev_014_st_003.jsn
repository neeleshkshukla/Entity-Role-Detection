The Congress and the Left Parties today expressed deep shock over the killing of 13 persons , mostly schoolchildren , at an Independence Day parade by militants at Dhemaji in Assam . The Congress said the incident was a powerful reminder of the continuing threat of terrorism in the sensitive border States . No words were adequate to condemn this ` dastardly act . ' . . ` It calls for continued vigil on the part of the intelligence agencies , police and administration to prevent recurrence of such incidents , '' the party spokesperson , Anand Sharma , said adding that in some regions , some foreign countries were providing covert assistance to terror . . . The Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- said the ` horrific crime ' came in the background of a call for boycott by the United Liberation Front of Assam -LRB- ULFA -RRB- of the Independence Day celebrations . In a statement , the Polit Bureau conveyed its heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed . . . It said the State Government should spare no effort to hunt down the culprits ` responsible for this heinous crime ' and also urgently enquire into how the blast in Dhemaji and other places took place when heightened security arrangements were in place . The party said that all the democratic political forces in Assam must unitedly mobilise the people to isolate the extremists and disruptive elements ` who have no compunctions in targeting innocent children and people . '' . . The Communist Party of India said ` the dastardly crime ' was committed through a bomb blast by remote control in a ` terrible atmosphere ' created by the boycott call by the ULFA . While expressing its condolences to the families of those killed , the party urged the State Government to track down the culprits and take punitive action .",
