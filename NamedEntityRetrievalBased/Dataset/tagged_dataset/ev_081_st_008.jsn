    "content": "NEW DELHI : After the issue of involvement of Hindu outfits in the Malegaon blasts came up in Rajya Sabha , ABVP leaders organized a press meet to clear its name from the controversy . The members of BJP 's student outfit insisted that the party had nothing to do with the blasts in Malegaon in September this year and it was just a political conspiracy to defame ABVP and Hindu outfits . ` First ATS mentioned the possibility of Vidyarthi Parishad and VHP being involved in the blasts and then the matter was also raised in Rajya Sabha by a Congress MP . But ABVP is in no way involved in the blasts , '' said Sunil Bansal , regional organizing secretary , ABVP . He added , ` ABVP has even demanded that there should be a proper inquiry and ATS should come out with an evidence and not talk without any basis . They do n't have any proof against any ABVP activist . '' According to Bansal , the name of ABVP came up during the investigations after a bike was found near the blasts site in Malegaon . ` The bike belonged to Pragya Singh , who was an ABVP activist in 1997 and is now a sadhvi . She had sold off the bike before she took to spirituality , '' Bansal said.NSUI , meanwhile , is holding a protest march against ABVP 's alleged role in the Malegaon blasts on Friday .",
