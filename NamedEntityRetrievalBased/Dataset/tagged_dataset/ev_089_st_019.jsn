    "content": "Two powerful explosions ripped through crowded areas at Dilsukhnagar in the eastern part of the State capital on Thursday evening , killing 13 persons and injuring more than 83 . . . The first blast occurred at 6.50 p.m. on the citys busiest road that links it with Vijayawada ; as terrified people were scampering to safety , the second blast went off . . . Authorities say the explosions were caused by improvised explosive devices that could have been kept on bicycles or packed inside frames of bicycles . . . The twin blasts brought back painful memories of the August 25 , 2007 IED attacks in Lumbini Park , in front of the State secretariat , and at Gokul Chat in Kothi that killed 44 people . . . Incidentally , one of Thursdays blasts took place near a crowded foot over-bridge , where security forces defused an IED five years ago . The device was to go off along with the blasts in Lumbini Park and Gokul Chat . . . Eyewitnesses at Anand Tiffin Centre , near the spot where the first blast took place , said someone began shouting about a bomb going off . Even as confused people watched , the IED detonated .",
