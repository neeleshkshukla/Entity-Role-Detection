The NIA arrested Wasim , an Indian medical student based in Bangladesh.Sources told Headlines Today that Wasim is studying medicine in Bangladesh . He and four others allegedly hatched the plot in Bangladesh and took the help of his local contacts in Kishtwar , Jammu and Kashmir to carry out the attack.The NIA is working on the theory that Wasim was lured by the Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami in Bangladesh and his network in Jammu and Kashmir was used to send the e-mail claiming responsibility for the blast . NIA officials claimed that with Wasim 's arrest , they are on track to unearthing the conspiracy behind the blast and the plotters . Wasim 's arrest is the third in the Delhi High Court blast case . The NIA had earlier arrested Aamir Abbas and Abid Hussain , both residents of Kishtwar . Abid was arrested for sending the terror e-mail after the blast . The NIA was able to reach Wasim following the interrogation of Abbas.The September 13 bomb blast outside gate no 5 of the Delhi High Court left 15 people dead and over 70 injured . .",
