Several innocent lives have been lost in the Hyderabad blasts . The government should stop playing politics on the issue of terrorism . We want the government to take appropriate action . There should be better coordination between the Centre and the state governments , BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said . . . The main opposition party maintained that the blame-game should stop and the system of intelligence gathering and sharing of information between the Centre and the states should be looked into . . . Pledging all support to the government in the fight against terrorism , the BJP said the country should unitedly deal with the menace . However , it alleged that the government is not taking appropriate measures . . . This government should rise above vote-bank politics ... On every passing day , Mr. Shinde is being seen as an unsuccessful Home Minister , Mr. Prasad said . . . In the past , BJP has opposed National Counter Terrorism Centre on the grounds that it will encroach upon the policing rights of states . But BJP-ruled states maintain they are ready to cooperate on some aspects like sharing of information . . . Asked about Mr. Shindes charge that some states are opposed to NCTC , Mr. Prasad said , We are not against coordination between the Centre and the states . But why was there no coordination between the Andhra Pradesh STF and the Centre . The Centre says it had given intelligence inputs , but the state says it had not received any information .",
