Chidambaram on Friday said the Centre had prior intelligence on Thursdays serial blasts here and it was shared with the Assam government in the evening of December 31 , resulting in the police nearly succeeding in apprehending one of the three perpetrators of the blasts . . . Mr. Chidambaram said he spoke to Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Thursday morning about the intelligence input . . . The serial blasts on the New Years Day claimed five lives and left 62 injured . . . The police knew who the person is . They knew him by face and his family , and nearly succeeded in apprehending him . This time , with little bit of luck , he evaded the police . This time , the police were unlucky . Next time they will be lucky , Mr. Chidamabaram told reporters after a two-hour long meeting of the Unified Command . . . The meeting was attended by Mr. Gogoi and top Army , police , paramilitary forces and intelligence officials . . . Soon after Mr. Chidamabarams briefing , the police released a photograph of Pranjal Deka alias Biju Sarania , a cadre of the United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- , who they suspect to be behind the blast at Birubari . . . Mr Chidambaram said that while escaping , Deka dumped a bomb in a trash bin and two of his associates planted explosive devices at Bhootnath and Bhagagarh . Two of the three perpetrators are known to the police . I have full faith on the ability of the police to apprehend them . . . Broad guidelines had issued to the Unified Command that it should have a more sharply focused strategy . . . No quarter will be given to militancy . Any banned organisation will be dealt with firmly and decisively , said the Minister . These organisations must get the clear message that the security forces would deal decisively and firmly with them . . . Mr. Chidambaram said he requested the Chief Minister and his Cabinet to devote their entire energy on development issues . While the Chief Minister and his government deal with development issues , the security forces will decisively deal with anyone who threatens the countrys sovereignty . . . Earlier , inaugurating the 11,111 th branch of State Bank of India at Sonapur in Kamrup district , the Home Minister said that whatever may be the obstacles and threats to the Assam people , the United Progressive Alliance government was determined to bring development to the State . However formidable the obstacles may be , we are determined to overcome them . . . Welcoming Bangladesh Prime Minister elect Sheikh Hasinas statement , expressing her willingness to work with India in fighting terror as positive , he said : We hope that we can make a new beginning and we can neutralise the leadership of the banned organisations , who have found sanctuary in Bangladesh . The Minister refused to compare the October 30 serial blasts in the State with the Thursdays blasts .",
