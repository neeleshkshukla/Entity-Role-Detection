NEW DELHI : The Haryana police have so far not come across any evidence to link the man detained at Bikaner in Rajasthan to the Samjhauta Express blasts near Panipat a week ago . They are now questioning over a dozen people picked up on the basis of their resemblance to the sketches of the suspects . . . The police have thoroughly interrogated Salman , who was picked up from the residence of a railway employee at Bikaner and brought to Panipat on Friday , but nothing has come of it yet . . . Following the release of sketches of the suspects , the police have received a number of calls from the public . Acting on the tip-offs , they have picked up more than a dozen people , some of who belong to Uttar Pradesh . ` They are being questioned to find out where they were on Sunday night at the time of the blasts , ' said a police officer . . . Few fingerprints . . It is learnt that a forensic team has lifted a few fingerprints from inside one of the suitcases containing the unexploded bomb , which would be matched with those being brought for questioning . . . The police had earlier picked up a Pakistani , Zahid , for questioning . However , he was released on Saturday after verification of his antecedents . . . Zahid told the police that he was to return to Lahore along with his mother and younger brother by the Samjhauta Express on Sunday night , but due to a quarrel with his brother at the old Delhi station , he changed his plans and returned to Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh . . . Meanwhile , efforts of the Special Cell of the Delhi police to find out the place from where the suitcases , used for planting the bombs , had been purchased have not yielded any results .",
