    "content": "National Security Adviser Ajit Doval -LRB- second from left -RRB- inspects Burdwan blast siteNew Delhi/Kolkata : National Security Adviser Ajit Doval , one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's most trusted officers , today met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , whose government has been accused of mishandling the investigation into the blast in Burdwan on October 2 and ignoring rising lawlessness near the border with Bangladesh.Earlier in the day , Mr Doval visited Burdwan where the blast has raised fears about a terror plot with international links . Two suspected Bangladeshi militants were killed in what appears to be an accidental blast in a rented house where bombs were being assembled . Four persons , including two women have been arrested ; one of them is the wife of a terror suspect who died in the blast.Sources say Mr Doval will urge Ms Banerjee to cooperate with central investigators . The state police have been accused of multiple lapses in the blast probe . The arrested persons allegedly told the police about another house where more bomb-makers were allegedly hiding , a kilometer away from the blast site . Eight days after the state police searched and sealed the house , the National Investigation Agency found 39 crude bombs in one of its toilets.The Chief Minister , however , defended her forces , saying , `` Our police have done a good job . `` On Saturday , National Investigation Agency chief Sharad Kumar inspected the house where the blast took place . The agency later said that all four arrested persons are members of the terror group , Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh . It also said that the accused were preparing crude bombs to transport them to Bangladesh for possible terror attacks.The Centre is worried about a larger plot to destabilize a friendly government in Bangladesh . A dossier being prepared by the government will be shared with Dhaka , which had sought details on the case . .",
