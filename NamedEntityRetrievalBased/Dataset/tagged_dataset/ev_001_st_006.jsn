Most of the injured are either morning shoppers or vendors , ' police official S. Rai told IANS by telephone.The victims were shifted to a local hospital with multiple injuries.Police blamed the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom - , a rebel group fighting for an independent Assamese homeland since 1979 , for the blast . Assam has been rocked by a string of explosions in the past two weeks . Two people were killed in an explosion in Guwahati last week.In the past two months , the ULFA staged at least 24 bomb explosions in Assam and launched a fresh attack on Hindi-speaking migrant workers , killing 10 of them in separate raids during the past 10 days . The ULFA was also blamed for a string of attacks in January in which 80 people were killed , 61 of them Hindi-speaking migrant workers.The central government launched a massive military offensive against the ULFA after the strikes killing 55 rebels and arresting 553 more cadres since January . More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in Assam during the past two decades . .",
