Some members of the film fraternity have already agreed to take out a campaign on the city streets on Tuesday and Wednesday for peace and public participation in the Republic Day function . . . The schools have been requested to send maximum number of students to Judges Field . Senior citizens in their respective wards and localities will inspire others to celebrate the day by at least hoisting the national flag . . . Adequate security arrangement has been made at Judges Field and police personnel in civil dress will be present on roads to arrest anyone who asks citizens to boycott the celebration . . . The sources said the last years twin blasts have forced the administration and police to chalk out a blueprint and throw a massive security blanket on and around Judges Field . The police are keeping some of the security plans secret so that the militants can not find any loophole in the arrangement and take advantage of the situation . . . Sniffer dogs are being used at frequent intervals to look for explosives at the field . A full backup system has been installed to ensure that there is no darkness at Judges Field even for a second till January 27 evening . . . The Assam State Electricity Board has been told to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the field and its surrounding areas . . .

Deputy commissioner Sinha said there has to be a consistent effort to make the younger generation understand the significance of Republic Day . . .

Everyone should come forward and celebrate the day with the rest of the country , a senior citizen said .",
