The outlawed group instead charged militants of the Hmar Peoples Convention ( Democratic ) with harassing the villagers , forcing the exodus . . . In a statement , Ksh . Yoiheiba , senior publicity officer of the UNLF , claimed that the villagers fled after the HPC ( D ) warned village chiefs against providing food and shelter to his organisations members . The UNLF also accused its rival of conniving with the army . . . The statement dismissed allegations about the UNLF using the villagers as human shields as false propaganda of Indian intelligence agencies to strain the outfits relationship with the villagers . . . The UNLF still has a good relationship with the villagers . Such propaganda will not bear fruit , it said .",
