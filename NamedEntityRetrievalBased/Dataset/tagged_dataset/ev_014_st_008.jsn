In a statement e-mailed to the local media , self-styled Commander-in-Chief of the ULFA , Paresh Barua , described the Dhemaji blast as the most tainted chapter of ULFAs revolutionary history and the most brutal and heinous murder of children and women . . . Barua claimed that ULFA had denied its hand in the blast as those ULFA cadres who had triggered it , misinformed higher-ups in the militant outfit that the blast was the handiwork of the occupational forces . . . We did not realise that our statement issued at that time was incorrect . However , later when the real truth came to light , we realised that our statement was incorrect . So we seek the apology of the people of Assam , Barua said . . . The ULFA military chief alleged that those cadres who were involved in the Dhemaji blast had already been expelled from the outfit .",
