    "content": "Terrorists struck for the first time in Jaipur triggering nine serial blasts in a span of 15 minutes on Tuesday night in crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled city leaving at least 90 killed.We have information that 80 people have died , Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria was quoted by AFP as saying . Earlier , Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje told reporters that 60 people had died and200 were injured.Bangladesh-based Harkut-ul-Jehadi Islami ( HuJI ) is suspected to be behind the blasts that has taken the state authorities by surprise , Home Ministry sources said.The use of RDX has been suspected in the carefully orchestrated low-intensity explosions which were suspected to have been set off from cycles in areas including near Hawa Mahal which are frequented by domestic and foreign tourists.The blasts rocked Tripolia Bazar , where large number of devotees turned up at a Hanuman temple , Johari Bazar , Manas Chowk , Badi Choupal and Choti Choupal -- all located within a two-km radius in the old city . According to sources , there were nine blasts , a couple of them in the same area.Police said four explosive was defused by bomb disposal squad , including one near the Hanuman temple.Blood was splattered at the scene of the blasts which tossed some of the victims several feet up.The Centre rushed Bomb Data squad of the National Security Guards ( NSG ) to Jaipur . Rajasthan Director General of Police A S Gill said the blasts were obviously a terror attack . The Union Home Ministry reviewed the situation . The bomb blasts came eight months after terrorists struck at Ajmer in which two persons were killed.Doctors said many of the victims had shrapnel injuries . They feared that the toll may go up further.The blasts triggered panic and a stampede-like situation amid allegations by opposition parties that there was a total intelligence failure.Rapid Action Force ( RAF ) personnel were deployed in Jaipur to help deal with the situation as security was beefed up.One of the blasts took place in a car and another near a handloom shop in Kotwali area of the city , home department sources said.Most of the injured were rushed to Sawai Man Singh hospital . Bodies of several victims lay strewn in the corridors of hospitals.The blasts triggered a near-stampede situation at the blast sites crammed with peak-hour shoppers as panic-stricken people ran helter skelter in search of a safe place.The Hanuman temple at Tripolia bazar was crowded with worshippers being a Tuesday.Preliminary investigations revealed that cycle ballbearings were used in the explosions to inflict shrapnel injuries on the victims . A clock timer was also found at one of the blast sites . Medical teams were rushed from Ajmer and Kota to cope up with the situation to render aid.Severed limbs , mangled heaps of cycle rickshaws , bicycles and smashed windscreens of cars turned the crowded markets crammed with peak-time shoppers in Pink City into a virtual war zone minutes after serial bomb blasts were set off.We heard a big sound and what was left was a plume of smoke and blood all around , said an injured eyewitness as he was stretchered to a hospital.Utter chaos and panic prevailed soon after the blasts took place in a span of 15 minutes.Scores of wounded people were ferried to three hospitals soon after blasts hit at Tripolia Bazar , Johari Bazar , Manank Chowk , Badi Choupad and Choti Choupad in the walled part of the city.People were also seen carrying the injured as the number of ambulances fell far short of the requirement.The nearby hospitals were crowded as relatives thronged to look for their near and dear ones.IPL chief Lalit Modi said a league match scheduled to be played in Jaipur on Saturday will go on as planned . .",
