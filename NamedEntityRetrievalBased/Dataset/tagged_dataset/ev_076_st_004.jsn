The All India Milli Council , Jamaat-Islami Hind and All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat said that no effort should be spared to nab the culprits behind these dastardly crimes . They offered condolences and sympathies to the families of those killed and also the injured . . . Call for impartial probe . . Demanding a high-level impartial and time-bound investigation , secretary general of Jamaat-e-Islami Nusrat Ali cautioned the government and the intelligence agencies against harassing innocent people . Intelligence agencies should not float certain names without proper investigation . The government must look into the real motives of perpetrators of such crimes , he said . . . He appealed to the people to remain calm and united against forces trying to disrupt communal harmony . . . All India Milli Council general secretary M. Manzoor Alam said the quick succession in which the blasts occurred in the two States was stunning . For quite some time , we have had this haunting feeling that we are not able to stop such violence because we have somehow been avoiding thinking out of the box , he said . . . The timing of the blasts , in the run-up to the general election , posed the question who stands to gain from such attacks . . . We hope that investigations will include all probable groups and individuals , than focussing on the usual suspects alone . Only comprehensive and fresh thinking will yield any results in our endeavour to put an end to such violence , he said . . . Form neutral panel . . All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushwarat president Zafarul Islam Khan urged the government to form a high-power neutral panel of retired judges , human rights activists , top lawyers and journalists to oversee the investigations .",
