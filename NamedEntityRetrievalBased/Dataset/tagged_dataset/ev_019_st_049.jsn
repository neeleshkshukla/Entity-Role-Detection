India has also sought details from Bangladesh about the interrogation report of two alleged JMB militants Asif Adnan , 26 , and Fazle Elahi Tanjil , 24 , who were arrested from Segunbagicha area of Dhaka city . `` Considering all these facts , it is necessary for the investigators to visit Bangladesh sooner than later , '' a source said . India will also hand over a dossier to the Bangladesh government for preventive steps and necessary action which has to be taken by Dhaka to counter the threat posed by JMB , sources added.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had visited Burdwan for first-hand knowledge of the conspiracy being hatched by the JMB to target Bangladesh government from the Indian soil.The Narendra Modi government has made it clear that it will have friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and following that policy , the NIA has been asked to complete the investigation into the October 2 blast as soon as possible , sources said . .",
