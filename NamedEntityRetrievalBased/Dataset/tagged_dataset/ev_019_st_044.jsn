The agency also said that the accused were preparing improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- for transporting them to Bangladesh for possible terror attacks . `` Investigation so far has revealed that the accused persons and their associates were the members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen , Bangladesh -LRB- JMB -RRB- , a terrorist organisation proscribed in Bangladesh and they were preparing IEDs which were being transported to Bangladesh , '' the NIA said in a statement on Friday.Two men , Shakil Ahmed and Suvon Mandal alias Subhan - both allegedly residents of Bangladesh - were killed while making the IEDs in a rented house in Khagragarh in Burdwan . A third , Abdul Hakim alias Hassan was injured . He was arrested by the NIA along with three others , including two women - one of them is the widow of a terror suspect who died in the blast.On Friday , NIA chief Sharad Kumar visited Burdwan and inspected the house where the blast occurred . He also visited another house at nearby Mathpara in Burdwan where 39 IEDs were found on October 17 by the NIA ; 37 of them were detonated . The house , incidentally , had been searched and sealed by the state police eight days before the NIA recovered the IEDs . `` We have evolved strategies regarding arrests of absconding accused persons . I ca n't reveal anything because it will affect the investigation , '' Mr Kumar told reporters.The NIA is also considering announcing cash rewards for any information leading to the `` arrest of those absconding accused of this case which include JMB members from Bangladesh '' . National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is likely to visit Burdwan on Monday to take stock of the investigation.The government is preparing a dossier which will be shared with Bangladesh which had sought details on the case . .",
