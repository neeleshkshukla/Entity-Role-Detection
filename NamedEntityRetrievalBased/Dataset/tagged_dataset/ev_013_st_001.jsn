Seven passengers were killed and 18 others injured in a bomb blast in a bus in upper Assam 's Sivasagar district this morning . . . Police suspect the banned United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- , to be behind it . . . As soon as the bus reached Majgaon area under Mathurapur police station , a powerful blast ripped apart the bus killing four passengers , including a woman on the spot , and injuring 18 others . While one passenger died at Sonari Civil Hospital , two others died on way to the Assam Medical College Hospital -LRB- AMCH -RRB- in neighbouring Dibrugarh district . Seven of the critically injured passengers were admitted to the AMCH . . . Police were still trying to ascertain if the blast occurred inside the bus or an explosive device had been planted on the road . A gas cylinder carried by one of the passengers could have added to the intensity to the blast . This was the sixth blast in a fortnight in the upper Assam districts of Tinsukia , Dibruagarh and Sivasagar .",
