It is for the first time that the government has pointed towards the involvement of a homegrown terror group for the three explosions in the metropolis . . . The Home Minister also said all over the world right-wing fascist forces were on the rise and India is no exception to it . . . `` While no conclusion has been reached , all indications point to Indian module , '' Chidambaram said about the Mumbai blasts , adding that perhaps it could be the same module that carried out a blast in the German Bakery in Pune last year . . . He said that while there was a finger-pointing for every terror incident towards the neighbouring country , a clear reference to Pakistan , there is also an existence of home grown terror modules as right wing fascist forces . . . `` We can not live in denial . We can not close our eyes to facts . There are home grown modules . Indian modules . They do not belong to one religion , '' Chidambaram said . . . The Pune and Mumbai blasts are `` two major blots on my career , I accept it , '' he said . . . Chidambaram said another mistake was to point fingers at a particular religion whenever a bomb blast took place .",
