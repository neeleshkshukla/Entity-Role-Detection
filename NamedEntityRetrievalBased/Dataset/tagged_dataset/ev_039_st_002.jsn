Police have also released pictures of two ULFA cadre Manohar Rajbongshi and Pradeep Kalita suspected to have entered Guwahati ahead of ULFA 's raising day on April 7 . . . They are suspected to be behind the blast that rocked Guwahati on Monday in which seven people were killed and several other injured . . . There were three more blasts across Assam - in Dhekaijuli , Mankachar and Udalgiri - which killed one and injured several others . . . The blasts happened despite high security in view of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's visit to the state on Tuesday . . . Earlier , in New Delhi Union Home Minister P Chidambaram presented a report card on terror saying only the Congress can deal with terror . . . Condemning the Assam bomb blasts he said that India 's pluralitistic nature makes it a target . . . Chidambaram promised that if the Congress will be voted to power , the party will set up a war room headed by Cabinet Secretary to deal with terror . . . `` Congress is alive to challenges posed by terrorism and can provide a strong leadership to fight it , '' he added . . . Referring to the Assam blasts , Chidambaram said : `` ULFA has waged a virtual war against the Indian state and the Government has strong reasons to believe that the perpetrators of Guwahati blast belong to the banned outfit . '' . . Expressing his concern over the recent terror attacks , he said that security situation in South Asia is deteriorating very sharply and major steps should be taken soon . . . `` We are in the middle of a ring of fire , '' Chidambaram warned . . . .",
