Zheviho who was at crowded Dimapur railway stationwhere one bomb exploded as passengers awaited a train.Two other bombs went off in the Hong Kong market , which sellsChinese goods , and an adjacent market . `` I had a miraculous escape , '' Zheviho told AFP by telephone fromDimapur , 70 kilometers ( 45 miles ) east of Nagaland capital Kohima.Police said the plastic explosive RDX appeared to have been usedin the railway blast that created a huge crater beside a platform . `` We found a briefcase with fuse wires ... it contained RDX and atimer-device , '' V. Peseyie , Dimapur additional police chief , said.Seventeen more people were killed in a wave of attacks inneighbouring Assam , police said.Unidentified attackers raked shoppers with gunfire at amarketplace in Makri Jhora village , 290 kilometres ( 180 miles ) west ofAssam 's main city of Guwahati , killing 11 and injuring about a dozen , policesaid.The same gunmen later shot dead four more villagers in a nearbyforest , police superintendent L. R. Bishnoi told AFP . Two more people werekilled and 10 injured in two blasts in the Assamese district of Bongaingaon ,220 kilometres ( 136 miles ) from Guwahati , Bishnoi said.One person was killed and seven wounded in an earlier bomb blastin Assam.Police also reported two other bombings in a village on theoutskirts of Guwahati in which four people were injured.There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the day ofbloodshed in the insurgency-infested northeast where some 30 guerrillagroups are battling for greater autonomy or independence.The attacks occurred as India marked the 135th anniversary ofthe birth of Mahatma Gandhi who waged a campaign of non-violence to free thecountry from British rule . `` It is distressing such violence broke out on the birthanniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , '' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in thecapital New Delhi.Nagaland 's ill-equipped hospitals battled to treat the wounded . `` Many have multiple face and abdomen wounds . They 're in a stateof trauma . We 're trying to cope . We 've never had such a devastatingemergency , '' said doctor T. Lotha at a private hospital in Dimapur treatingblast victims.Nagaland Chief Minister Neibhiu Rio said at least 26 people werekilled in the Dimapur blasts and another 86 were in hospital . `` The deathtoll may go up as many are in a very critical condition , '' he said . `` This is the worst ever terrorist strike in Nagaland . People arestill dealing with the shock -- they 're not yet thinking about who toblame . `` Mourners crowded churches across Nagaland , which is mostlyChristian , to pray for the victims.The blasts were the second major burst of violence in thenortheast since mid-August . Fifteen people , many of them children , werekilled in a rebel attack on an Independence Day parade in Assam August 15for which the United Liberation Front of Asom claimed responsibility.The armed insurgency in Nagaland began soon after much of thelocal population converted to Christianity . Many militant groups , seeking tosecede from India to form an independent Christian state , are funded andarmed by the Southern Baptist Church . Some of the groups such as theNational Liberation Front of Tripura have been involved in a campaign of `` gunpoint conversions '' and `` ethnic cleansing '' of native non-Christians , which has left over 50,000 dead and many more refugees over the past twodecades.Source : http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1503&ncid=1503&e=6&u=/afp/20041002/ts_afp/india_northeast_blast .",
