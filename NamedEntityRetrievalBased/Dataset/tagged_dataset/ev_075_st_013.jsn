With the Bangladesh-based HuJI being suspected to be behind the blasts , state PWD Minister Rajendra Singh Rathore said the state government is on a hunt for Bangladeshis with suspected criminal background . Forty such Bangladeshi nationals have been rounded up so far and are being interrogated , he said . Eight of them were detained in Ajmer . All District Collectors and Superintendents of Police have been directed to complete within 30 days the process of identifying Bangladeshi migrants living with or without voter ID cards and/or ration cards and get them verified , Rathore said . The procedures for deporting the identified illegal nationals could then be started , he said . The process has begun everywhere in the state , he added . The State 's Principal Home Secretary discussed with his central counterpart on Friday the option of deporting illegally staying Bangladeshi nationals , he added .
