After a two-hour meeting with the Chief Minister and senior officials , Prakash Mishra , Special Secretary -LRB- Internal Security -RRB- at the Union Home Ministry said the Centre and West Bengal are together in fighting terror . . . The visit of senior Home Ministry officials is crucial as the Trinamool Congress had initially opposed the probe by National Investigation Agency -LRB- NIA -RRB- . Recently Ms. Banerjee had expressed displeasure that the Centre had not taken her into confidence while ordering the probe . . . I am very happy to say that the Chief Minister has given an assurance that the Centre and State will work together in unearthing the entire case , Mr. Mishra told journalists . . . Mr. Mishra also added that the Home Ministry will work on improving the capacity of State police and central forces engaged in this operation so that the investigation reaches its logical end .",
