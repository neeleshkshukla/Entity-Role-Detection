    "content": "In a new twist to Malegaon bomb blasts probe , three accused on Wednesday made a confession before a competent authority about their involvement in the conspiracy but soon thereafter two of them retracted before a magistrate , saying they had not made a voluntary disclosure . . . Farooq Anwar Iqbal Maqdumi , Shaikh Mohammed Ali Alam Shaikh and Asif Khan Bashir Khan alias Junaid purportedly made a confession this morning before a Deputy Commissioner of Police , a competent authority to record confession under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act . . . Later , Shaikh Mohammed Ali and Asif Khan alias Junaid retracted their confession before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate , saying it was not given voluntarily . . . This was revealed to a special court by the accused themselves when they were produced before it for remand . . . The development assumes significance as under MCOCA , a confession does not have evidential value if it is not a voluntary and true disclosure . . . Altogether five accused were produced before judge Mridula Bhatkar who remanded four of them -- Salman Farsi , Farooq Anwar , Shaikh Mohammed and Asif Khan to judicial custody till December 15 and Mohammed Zahid Abdul Majid to police custody till December 16 . . . Seeking their remand , public prosecutor Raja Thakre said the accused had played a vital role in the conspiracy and investigations conducted by Anti-Terrorist Squad so far had revealed involvement of more persons who are yet to be arrested . .",
