NEW DELHI : The Delhi State Committee of the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- on Saturday condemned the heinous blast perpetrated by terrorist elements at Mehrauli here . . . CPI -LRB- M -RRB- Delhi State Committee secretary P.M.S. Grewal said the second terror attack in Delhi within a span of two weeks was a grim reminder of the failure of the Union Government and its intelligence agencies to uncover and neutralise terror networks . . . The Government must take all necessary steps to apprehend the culprits of the barbaric crimes , he said . . . Expressing concern over the bomb blasts in the Capital , Mr. Grewal said : What is required are not tougher anti-terror laws as is being advocated by the BJP but the will and determination to unitedly combat terrorism . This is borne out by the fact that the terrorist attacks on Parliament , Red Fort and Akshardham Temple took place when POTA was in force .",
