' ` Police never get their hands on the real masterminds of blasts ... They just pick up people at random and parade them before the media and congratulate themselves . This leads to a race to grab credit -LRB- for cracking cases -RRB- , ' the party alleged in an editorial in its mouthpiece , Saamana . ` Pragya Singh is a victim of this race to claim credit , ' the editorial charged . It further said that in today 's atmosphere of insecurity , Muslim fundamentalists are to blame if at all a Hindu takes to terrorism . ` If a Hindu organisation is taking on useless secularism , the Anti-Terrorist Squad must not brand it as a terrorist outfit , ' it said . The editorial also condemned the attack by NCP workers on the Vishwa Hindu Parishad office in Nashik in the wake of of the sadhvi 's arrest . ` Just because NCP controls the home ministry -LRB- in the state -RRB- , we hope they have not got a license to do what they want , ' it said . ` Why did they ever not attack SIMI offices ? NCP member advocate Majid Memon defended the 1993 blasts ' accused . Has anybody ever touched him ? ' it asked . ` Those who put Sadhvi Pragya Singh behind bars and those who attacked the VHP office in Nashik belong to the same club , ' the editorial accused .",
