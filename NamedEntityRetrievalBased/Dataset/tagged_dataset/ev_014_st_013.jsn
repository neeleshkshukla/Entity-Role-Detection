    "content": "National Assam bandh near-total . . By Sushanta Talukdar . . GUWAHATI , AUG. 18 . Assam today observed a near-total bandh to protest against the killing of schoolchildren in a bomb blast by the banned United Liberation Front of Asom -LRB- ULFA -RRB- in Dhemaji district on August 15 . There were no reports of any violence , barring a few incidents of stonethrowing . . . The 12-hour bandh , called separately by the All-Assam Students ' Union and the State unit of the CPI -LRB- M -RRB- , evoked a spontaneous response . The Opposition Asom Gana Parishad also supported the bandh . . . Life came to a standstill in the Brahmaputra Valley with traders downing their shutters ; education institutions , banks and other financial institutions remained closed . . . The roads in the city and districts wore a deserted look with public and private vehicles remaining off the road . Although trains and flights were running normally , passengers were stranded at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bardoloi International Airport at Borjhar and Guwahati railway stations as no taxis or other public transport was available . . . Attendance in Government offices , particularly the State Secretariat at Dispur , was thin . The State-run Assam Transport Corporation did not ply any buses in the city . . . Students burnt tyres in the Panabazar locality to prevent the movement of vehicles . Police made preventive arrests of about 20 AASU leaders and activists last night and released them this evening . . . Condemning the ULFA for the attack on the schoolchildren , the AASU held the State Government responsible for their deaths . . . The student body accused the State Government of failing to protect the lives and property of the people and demanded that the Chief Minister , Tarun Gogoi , resign owning moral responsibility .",
