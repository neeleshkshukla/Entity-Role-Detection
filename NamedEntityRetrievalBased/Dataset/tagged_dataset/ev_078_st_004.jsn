    "content": "NEW DELHI : It has become nauseatingly familiar . Low-intensity bombs placed in crowded markets , killing and maiming children , their parents , unsuspecting shoppers , unmindful of their caste , creed or religion . Within a month and a half of Jaipur , Bangalore and Ahmedabad terror blasts , Delhi was mauled on Saturday leaving 30 innocents dead and 90 injured . -LRB- Watch -RRB- In all , five bombs went off in less than half an hour . Two of them in the heart of Delhi in Connaught Place , two at the upscale Greater Kailash M Block market in south Delhi , and one , the most damaging one , in the crowded Ghaffar Market in Karol Bagh.Three more bombs were defused , one of them at the popular Children 's Park in India Gate , indicating the depraved mind of the terrorists.The Indian Mujahideen , regarded by security agencies as a front of the Lashkar-Huji terror machine , has claimed responsibility for the blasts . The Indian Mujahideen email , titled ` the Message of Death ' , said : ` In the name of Allah , Indian Mujahideen strikes back once more . ... Do whatever you can . Stop us if you can . ' This group had sent emails before the UP court blasts , the Jaipur and Ahmedabad blasts . This time , too , it sent an email to media groups , however , 10 minutes after the first blast . And for the third time , it specifically threatened The Times of India for attacking terror.The first blast took place at Ghaffar Market at 6.10 pm . Soon after that , two explosions rocked Connaught Place , one at Barakambha Road near Gopaldas Building at 6.30 pm and the other near the Metro station at the Central Park at 6.31 pm . Almost simultaneously , a blast hit M-block market in Greater Kailash-I near McDonald 's and seven minutes later another bomb went off near Prince Pan Corner in the same market.All blasts were of low intensity , and the defused bombs suggest they used the cocktail of ammonium nitrate , gun powder , ball bearings and nails , with timer devices , the same kind of bombs that were used in Jaipur , Bangalore and Ahmedabad , indicating that it 's the same group that 's wreaking terror across the country.Eyewitnesses said that explosives at Connaught Place were kept in a dustbin in Central Park of Connaught Place while at Gopaldas building , the bombs were kept in a dustbin next to the bus stand . An 11-year-old boy , Rohit -LRB- name changed -RRB- who had witnessed two persons wearing a black dress putting two plastic bags inside the dustbin , is being examined by the cops.Police say the first blast in Karol Bagh was the result of a Compressed Natural Gas -LRB- CNG -RRB- cylinder explosion . The impact of the blasts in Karol Bagh could be gauged by the fact that an auto was thrown up in the air and got caught in the electrical wires . ` The terrorist have used the CNG autorickshaw to maximise the impact and we have so far not been able to find the number plate of the vehicle , ' said a police officer.Eyewitnesses claim that explosives were loaded on a bicycle near Prince Pan Centre in GK I and another inside a dustbin near McDonald 's . All the blasts were of low intensity and ball bearings were used to maximize the impact , said investigators . In GK 's M block market , the blast took place next to a Maruti car to maximise the impact but it did not explode averting a bigger tragedy . Cops said that a low intensity blast with a timer was used to trigger the blast . The second blast which took place next to a pan shop was higher intensity but shopkeepers and shoppers had evacuated the area by then , reducing the human loss . All the blast sites were popular shopping destinations , and all of them were teeming with people on weekend shopping.Three unexploded bombs were found later taking the total number of bombs to 8 . The first was found near India Gate inside a dustbin at the Children 's Park and one was defused at Regal Cinema Hall which was lying on the road , while another one was found at Central Park , again inside a dustbin . A National Security Guard -LRB- NSG -RRB- team defused the bombs after they were informed by the witnesses about unclaimed objects . NSG experts were assessing the situation and nature of explosives used .",
