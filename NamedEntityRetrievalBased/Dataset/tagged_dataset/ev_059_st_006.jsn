    "content": "New Delhi , May 22 : Blasts rocked two Delhi theatres , both screening a film that has angered Sikh religious bodies , within minutes of each other this evening , killing one and injuring at least 40 people . . . The large Sunday audience was watching Jo Bole So Nihaal at Karol Baghs Liberty hall when a bomb kept under a seat ripped off the first 15 to 20 seats , injuring over 30 people . . . The explosion at Patel Nagars Satyam cinema occurred in the ground floor toilet . Chief fire officer R.C. Sharma would not confirm a bomb blast . . . Some people said there was an explosion in the air-conditioning and we are looking into it , he said . . . All other theatres in the city were evacuated within minutes . No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts . . . The film was withdrawn from all cinemas across Punjab last week following a protest by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee . . . Jagir Kaur , the president of the committee , condemned the blasts , saying the Sikhs were not against the film but some objectionable scenes .",
