    "content": "Srinagar attack : After the deadly fidayeen assault on the CRPF camp in Srinagar , that left 5 CRPF troops dead , the diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan has yet again spilled over onto the sporting arena . The Indian government has refused permission for a home-and-away bilateral hockey series between the two countries on security grounds . . . A top source in Hockey India today said that they have received a communication from the Ministry of External Affairs asking it call off the bilateral series . . . `` The bilateral series between India and Pakistan has been cancelled as the Ministry of External Affairs did not give us permission . The MEA had sent a fax to us yesterday , asking us not to host Pakistan or travel to the country for the series , '' the source said . . . The Pakistan 's hockey team was scheduled to tour India next month for five Test matches , which would have revived the bilateral hockey ties between the two traditional rivals in nearly seven years . . . Pakistan was expected to play matches in the cities of Ranchi , Lucknow , Delhi , Mohali and Jalandhar between April 5-15 . . . After Pakistan 's visit , the Indian team was scheduled to pay a return visit and play five matches in Lahore , Faisalabad , Karachi and Sialkot from April 23 . . . Pakistan and India last played a bilateral hockey series in 2006 -- three matches in each country . Pakistan won three and lost one while the remaining two were drawn . . . The cancellation of the hockey rubber came close on the heels of an abandoned bilateral snooker series between India and Pakistan earlier this month following Government 's objection .",
