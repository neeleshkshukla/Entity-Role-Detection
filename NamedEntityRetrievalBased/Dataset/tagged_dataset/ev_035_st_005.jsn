The mob , shouting slogans such as ` Tarun Gogoi murdabad ' , was stopped at the gates of the seat of government by the security staff . The people demanded that ` Gogoi come out and see what your failure to protect the people has caused . It has killed innocent people ' . Street fights also erupted with people angered by the repeated bomb blasts in Ganeshguri , which is adjacent to the high security Secretariat and Assembly . The area was targeted by ULFA earlier several times killing many in the vegetable market . Angered by the alleged police delay in responding to the bomb blast , an irate mob set ablaze a fire-tender . To control the angry protestors , police resorted to blank firing , official sources said . Meanwhile , lawyers in Guwahati also have decided not to take up cases of militants in the courts following the serial blasts across the state . The lawyers took the decision as soon as the blast took place in front of the Kamrup District Deputy Commissioner 's office . Guwahati High Court Chief Justice J Chameleswar has also condemned the explosions as an ` attack on society ' .",
