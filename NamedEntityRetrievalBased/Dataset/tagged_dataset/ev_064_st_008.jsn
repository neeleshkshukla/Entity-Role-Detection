Hundreds continue the search for missing relatives We did as much as we could : Mumbai police Investigation handed over to Anti-Terrorist Squad . . MUMBAI : Just 12 hours after seven serial blasts left a trail of death and woes , Mumbai moved towards normality on Wednesday . . . Photo Gallery : Mumbai Suburban Train Blasts : The Day After . . Even as the day broke over a city that has still to recover from Tuesday terror , trains began running on the very tracks where bombs ripped through carriages . And office goers , school and college students and workers made their way to different parts of the city . . . The aftermath of the bombings , however , hung heavy on the city , as hundreds of people continued their weary search for missing relatives and family members . . . The scenes at various government and municipal hospitals were heart-rending as scores of people waited for news about the identity of the injured and those killed . Many of the bodies in morgues had not been identified . . . Director General of Police P.S. Pasricha told the media that 186 people had died and 772 injured . Information centres , manned by senior officials , had been set up at hospitals . ` Mumbai people have shown their big hearts , ' he said referring to the way people helped those injured . . . Mr. Pasricha refused to hazard a guess about who was responsible for the bombings . He said the investigation had been handed over to the Anti-Terrorist Squad and samples from the targeted coaches sent to the Central Forensic Laboratory . He said he would not speculate about the nature of the explosive used although it did appear to be RDX , given the intensity of the blasts . . . Asked whether the bombings reflected an intelligence failure , he said , ` We are not super human beings . ' The police had some idea that Mumbai would be a target . ` We did as much as we could , ' he said , and referred to the police interception of supplies of RDX and guns in Nashik , Aurangabad and Malegaon two months back . . . Mr. Pasricha said security had been enhanced all over the State . The Central Reserve Police Force and the Rapid Action Force had also been deployed . . . Tracks repaired . . The most important factor that led to a semblance of normality on Wednesday was the speed with which the suburban train network was restored . On any ordinary day , this network transports an estimated six million people . Without it , the city can not move . Western Railway officials told The Hindu that within three hours of the first of the seven bomb blasts , a skeletal suburban rail service was started . . . From just before 10 p.m. on Tuesday night , services were run from Churchgate to Bandra and later to Andheri . As a result , stranded people had some chance to get back to their homes . . . By 1.20 a.m. , the Railways had begun the work of removing the rakes with the shattered carriages that were stationary at the different stations . . . The job was completed by a little before 6 a.m. . As a result , by 6.30 a.m. , the suburban rail network had begun functioning partially with trains running at 15 minute intervals . . . By 10 a.m. , normal services were resumed . However , the number of people was fewer on Wednesday than normal .",
