The Bhatkal brothers are in Pakistan . . . Preliminary investigations have shown the actual muscle to carry on the blasts was provided by Dr Shahnawaz , the brother of IM foot soldier Mohammed Saif who was arrested in the Batla House encounter in September 19 , 2008 . . . In that encounter , a week after the Delhi blasts , the then IM commander Atiq Amin was killed and Saif arrested . . . Dr Shahnawaz , who is both in Dubai and Pakistan now , took charge thereafter . A Pakistan-trained mujahideen , Shahnawz is in regular touch with the Bhatkal brothers , sources said . . . He is also involved in the Delhi , Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts . . . It was widely expected that the IM terror modules that operated out of Azamgarh had been wiped out after the Batla encounter . But that is not so . . . Preliminary investigations point at IM members based in the Sanjarpur-Saraimeer-Phulpur area of the Azamgarh district , just 100 kilometres from Varanasi . . . Dr Shahnawaz along with aides Khalid , Abu Rashid and Bada Sajid or Mohammed Sajid had fled to Nepal after the Batla House encounter . This former physician in Lucknow Hospital is purportedly now in both Dubai and Pakistan . All four now hold Nepalese passports . . Meanwhile , the email in which the banned terrorist group , Indian Mujahideen , claimed responsibility for the bomb blast in Varanasi originated from the suburb Vashi in Navi Mumbai . . . The email which was shot to several media houses minutes after the blast was sent through an unsecured WiFi connection of the Airtel broadband , official sources have said . . . The Indian Mujahideen module had hacked into a broadband Internet connection of a Navi Mumbai resident . . . ... contd .",
