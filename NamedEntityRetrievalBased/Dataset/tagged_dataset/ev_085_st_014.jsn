    "content": "New Delhi Islamist militants are being blamed for an explosion that killed at least one person and wounded more than 20 others at one of Hinduisms holiest sites Tuesday evening . . . The blast went off during a Hindu ceremony by the river Ganges in Varanasi , an ancient pilgrimage city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh at around 6:45 pm . Police were immediately put on high alert in Indias big cities . . . Several television channels and newspapers said they had received e-mails from an Islamist militant group , the Indian Mujahadeen ( IM ) , claiming it was behind the blast . . . The official investigation is just beginning . But Indian security pundits say the IM is an obvious suspect : The group has carried out a string of bombings in Indian cities , most recently in the southern city of Pune this February . It is linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who were behind the Mumbai attacks of 2008 . . . A police officer told local journalists a bomb appeared to have been hidden in a container on one of the ghats stone staircases that lead down to the Ganges , where people gather to say their prayers and bathe , particularly at sunrise and sunset . . . The bomb is thought to have killed a baby girl and injured at least 20 more , including an unknown number of foreigners . . . Perhaps Indias holiest city , Varanasi also known by its older name of Benares is always packed with Hindu pilgrims and foreign tourists . . . Some analysts say the IM is focusing on foreigners . The group was suspected of involvement in machine gun attack on tourists in the capital , New Delhi that wounded two foreigners in September , in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games . . . An offshoot of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India , the IM first emerged in 2007 and 2008 . Intelligence officials allege its operatives are being trained in Pakistan . They also say its threat has been reduced in recent months thanks to successful security operations . . . Police have been especially vigilant in Uttar Pradesh in recent months , following a controversial ruling over a religious site that has long divided Indias Hindu majority and Muslim minority . In September , a high court in the state ruled that a site in the town of Ayodhya should be divided between Hindu and Muslims groups , with the majority share going to Hindus . . . In 1992 , Hindu zealots had torn down a 17th century mosque at the site , unleashing India-wide riots that killed 2,000 people , most of them Muslim . . . The issue of the Babri Masjid ( mosque ) has lost some of its power to mobilize mass unrest in recent years . Indias Muslim community , though long marginalized and discriminated against , has been largely peaceful . Despite fears of a backlash after Septembers ruling , the state remained peaceful in the aftermath of the ruling . . . Varanasi is no stranger to militant attacks . In March 2006 , twin bombings blamed on a Pakistan-based Islamist militant group tore through a train station and a temple in the city , killing 20 people . . . .",
