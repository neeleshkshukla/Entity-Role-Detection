Dog squad . . Sources say that the security agencies concerned have issued instructions to the personnel manning the temple to remain vigilant to prevent untoward incidents during the ensuing Vaikunta Ekadasi festival , which attracts thousands of devotees to the shrine . . . A dog squad has also been deployed at the temple as part of heightened security measures . . . However , the deficiencies in the existing security mechanism , particularly the inadequate number of security personnel and lack of sophisticated security devices , have become a cause for concern . . . The temple security is being manned by the Special Protection Force consisting of two head constables and nine constables , in association with the town police . . . Foolproof plan . . In an effort to revamp the security set-up at the temple , the authorities concerned have drawn up a foolproof security plan and sent the proposals to the government for up-gradation of the whole security system at the temple long ago , sources added . . . The plan envisages enhancement of the security and surveillance mechanism , including strengthening of the existing CCTV camera system , and appointment of a SI rank officer to head the SPF team at the temple .",
