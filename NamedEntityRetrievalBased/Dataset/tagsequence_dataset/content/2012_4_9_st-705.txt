A car bomb blast outside a church in northern Nigeria on Easter Sunday killed at least 20 people and put the country on alert over fears of further attacks , rescue officials and residents said . The explosion , a stark reminder of Christmas Day attacks that left dozens of people dead in Africa 's most populous nation and largest oil producer , hit the city of Kaduna , a major cultural and economic centre in the north . Motorcycle taxi drivers and passers-by caught much of the blast . As news of the attack spread , security forces boosted patrols in key areas , including in the capital Abuja , where soldiers were sent to reinforce police posted near churches , an AFP correspondent reported .
