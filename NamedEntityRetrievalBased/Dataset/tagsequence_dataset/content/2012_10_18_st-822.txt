A suicide truck bomb attack on a joint Nato-Afghan army base in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday caused several casualties to Afghan forces , the International Security Assistance Force said . Reports by Afghan officials of the number of soldiers wounded in the attack varied from 10 to 45 , but there were no reports of any deaths . `` This morning a joint ISAF-ANSF ( Afghan National Security Forces ) combat outpost in Zurmat district in Paktiya province was attacked by insurgents using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device and indirect fire , '' an ISAF spokesman told AFP . `` Early reports say the attack resulted in several ANSF casualties , but there is currently no reporting on ISAF casualties , '' he said . Deputy provincial governor Abdul Rahman Mangal told AFP : `` Around 45 army soldiers have been slightly wounded , mostly by broken glass , by the huge blast caused by a truck bomb at the gate . '' The Taliban said their fighters had infiltrated the base after the suicide attack and fighting was continuing - claims denied by ISAF and Afghan officials.AFP OPEN
