Israel embassy official Tal Yehoshua Koren , who on Monday was the victim of a terror attack in New Delhi , said she was fortunate her children were not in the car that was bombed . The incident has prompted Israeli diplomats across the world to use taxis or public transport to commute . Ms. Koren was going to the American embassy school to fetch her children in a Toyota Innova when the vehicle was bombed . Three more persons , including her driver and two others in another car , were injured . Ms. Koren , wife of Israel 's defence attach , told the Israeli media that she remembers seeing the motorcyclist who apparently threw something in the direction of the car . She spoke from her hospital bed in Delhi to the Hebrew newspaper Yediot Acharonot . By dashing out of her vehicle when she saw the motorcyclist attaching the device to her car , she may have saved herself , israelnationalnews.com reported . Seconds later , there was a deafening blast and the car burst into flames . An Israeli diplomat in India said : We were always warned , and even more so recently , that we 're a target . But you do n't really understand it until it happens . We will continue working and doing what needs to be done , but one must admit , given that we have families , children it is scary , the diplomat was quoted as saying . High alert Israeli diplomats across the world were advised to use taxis or public transport after the attack in India and the foiled attack in Georgia . Israeli institutions have been placed on high alert , reported israelnationalnews.com . Citing a report on Channel 10 , the news website said Israel 's security agencies , including Mossad , have directed all diplomats not to use their own or embassy vehicles until these can be inspected . Officials were being sent home by taxi for fear that their vehicles may be booby-trapped , the report said . IANS OPEN
