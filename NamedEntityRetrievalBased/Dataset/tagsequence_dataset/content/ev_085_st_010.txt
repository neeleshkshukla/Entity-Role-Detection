HYDERABAD : Not leaving anything to chance in the aftermath of Varanasi bomb blast , the state intelligence has alerted the police commissionerates in Hyderabad and Cyberabad on possible attacks on Western nationals , especially those hailing from Holland , by terror groups . According to a departmental memo 425/CI/2010 dated December 6 , the intelligence wing has come to know of an exchange of SMSes that speak against the anti-Islam Dutch film ` Fitna ' -LRB- Devilry -RRB- made by right-wing politician Geert Wilders . One of the SMSes , the circular said , was ` Remember Allah may ask you one day what did you do when they made fun of My messenger ? ' Senior police officers , however , denied issuing any circular specifically mentioning Dutch nationals . The circular deals with general alert against the backdrop of Varanasi terrorist attack , they added . Some police officers said the circular related to Dutch nationals emanated from the central intelligence agencies and was not specific to Hyderabad . The circular is the result of Wilder 's recent tour of Israel where he was promoting his short film and demanding a campaign for banning the Muslim holy book ` The Koran . ' Police officers fear that hate-mongering against one group of people could provoke some to take law into their hands .
