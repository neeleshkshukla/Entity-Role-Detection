A female suicide bomber blew herself up in the southern Russian region of Dagestan on Saturday , injuring at least 18 . The attacker was later identified as a widow of two Islamist radicals killed by security forces . It was the first suicide bombing in Dagestan since the Boston Marathon attacks last month . The Tsarnaev brothers suspected of carrying out those blasts are ethnic Chechens who lived in this turbulent Caucasus province before moving to the U.S. . Since 2000 , at least two dozen women , most of them from the Caucasus , have carried out suicide bombings in Russian cities and aboard trains and planes . The bombers are often called black widows in Russia because many are the widows , or other relatives , of militants killed by security forces . AP OPEN
