A car bomb on Thursday ripped through a funeral tent in a mainly Shia area of Baghdad , the deadliest in a series of attacks that killed at least 40 people . The blasts were the latest in more than a week of bombings that have killed more than 200 people , raising concerns about an uptick in violence as the U.S. military prepares to withdraw from the country . The violence has mainly targeted the majority Shia community and Iraqi security forces , posing a major challenge to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his fragile coalition government that was seated last month . Suspicion The car that exploded about 2 pm on Thursday had been parked with the vehicles of other mourners , several metres away from the tent , so it would n't raise suspicion , said police . Several other cars were set afire and the force of the blast damaged nearby houses . At least 37 people , including four children and three women , were killed and 78 wounded , according to police and hospital officials . AP OPEN
