A powerful blast inside a house at Thillankery under the Iritty police station limits here on Sunday ripped off the house and left a youth seriously injured , raising suspicion that the explosion could have occurred while handling country-made bombs . The police said the people in the locality heard a huge sound of explosion at around 10 a.m. . The house where the explosion took place was at Iyyambode , near Thillankery , which is a politically sensitive area in the district . A youth identified as Roshith ( 22 ) , who the police described as a worker of the Democratic Youth Federation of India ( DYFI ) , sustained serious burns in the blast .
