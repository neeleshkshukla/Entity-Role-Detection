The rally was organised to celebrate the renaming of the NWFP as Khyber-Pukhtoonkhwa . A TTP spokesman told AFP that the attack was to avenge the drone attacks in North Waziristan and there would be more such attacks on any place where there are Americans . '' Preliminary investigations reveal that the suicide bombers , disguised as security personnel , rammed their bomb-laden vehicle into the security picket at the Consulate-General . In the confusion caused by the first blast , their associates lobbed grenades triggering a series of blasts and engaged in a gun battle with security personnel while attempting to enter the building . The U.S. Embassy confirmed that an attempt was made to enter the consulate premises . It said , The coordinated attack involved a vehicle suicide bomb and terrorists attempting to enter the building using grenades and weapons fire '' .
