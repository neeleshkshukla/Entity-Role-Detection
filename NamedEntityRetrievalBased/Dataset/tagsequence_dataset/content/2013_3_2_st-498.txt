The samples weighing 47 kg were handed over by police of Saroornagar , Malakpet and National Investigation Agency , FSL Director O. Narasimha Murthy said . He said aluminium pieces , nails , nuts and bolts and parts of bicycles , which were strapped with bombs , were referred to the lab for examining the chemical composition . The damaged motorcycles that were parked near the sites and the splinters recovered from bodies were also sent to the lab . Mr. Murthy said that the bombs were of high intensity and made of ammonium nitrate . They were concealed in tiffin boxes made of aluminium . The explosive materials were kept in wooden boxes in the earlier explosions at Gokul Chat and Lumbini Park in 2007 . The wooden boxes also had iron balls . But the aluminium boxes now had bolts and nails to provide the lethal element . Mr. Murthy added that the laboratory did not have the equipment to enhance the quality of the surveillance camera footage , which provided a blurred image of the suspected bomber .
