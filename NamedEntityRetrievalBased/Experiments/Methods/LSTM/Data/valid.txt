, O
on O
Monday O

set O
off O

when O

In O
2004 O
, O
the O
blast O
occurred O
when O
the O

was O
travelling O
in O
a O
tunnel O
, O
which O

it O
caused O
more O

the O
current O
two O

that O
ripped O

Eye-witnesses O
said O
that O
surprisingly O
there O
was O
little O
panic O
among O

this O
helped O
avoid O
more O

as O
thousands O

Both O

the O

not O
only O
halted O
train O
service O
on O
several O

but O
also O
paralysed O
all O

above O
as O

sealed O

it O

impossible O
to O
provide O
100 O
per O

protection O
to O
the O

Experts O
said O
it O
was O
not O
feasible O
to O
set O
up O
airport-style O

that O

detect O
explosives O

metal O

this O
would O

However O
, O

the O

chose O
evenings O
for O
the O
bloodshed O
on O
both O
occasions O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
inflict O
maximum O
damage O
as O
the O
movement O
of O

high O

was O
facilitated O
by O

the O
location O
chosen O
on O
Thursday O

The O
blasts O
occurred O
right O
across O
the O
road O

the O

failed O
to O
explode O
a O
bomb O
simultaneously O
with O
those O

the O
serial O
blasts O

succeeded O
only O
at O
two O
, O
killing O
42 O
persons O

The O
unexploded O
bomb O
was O
kept O
in O
the O

of O
a O

near O
the O
foot-over O
bridge O
which O
was O
50 O

which O
anybody O
could O
assemble O
as O
plastic O
explosives O
were O
no O
longer O
easy O

is O
why O
they O

Sources O
in O
the O
home O
ministry O
said O
that O
the O
emphasis O
on O
the O
sites O
which O
had O
already O
been O
reconnoitered O
reflected O
the O
assessment O
that O
the O
terrorists O
were O
under O
pressure O
to O
do O
something O
spectacular O
sooner O
than O
later O
and O
, O
hence O
, O
focussed O
on O
locales O
they O
were O
already O
familiar O
with O
. O

Centre O
refrained O
from O
blaming O
the O
state O

, O
with O
Shinde PER_Others
saying O
in O
Rajya ORG_Others

that O
the O
calm O
professionalism O
of O
AP LOC_Others
cops O
was O
worth O
emulating O
. O

But O
many O
in O
his O
own O

wondered O
whether O
cops O
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
carnage O
by O
upping O
their O
guard O
in O
response O
to O
a O
series O
of O
advisories O
. O

There O
was O
also O
puzzlement O
about O
the O
reasons O
why O
they O
failed O
to O
do O
so O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
terrorists O
had O
targeted O
the O
same O
spot O
in O
2007 O
. O

The O
last O
attempt O
failed O
only O
because O
the O
device O
planted O
by O
IM ORG_Accused
terrorists O
failed O
to O
go O
off O
, O
sparing O
the O
locality O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
the O

the O
same O
module O

Bhatkal PER_Others
had O
planted O
at O
Gokul LOC_Others
Chat LOC_Others
Bhandar LOC_Others
and O
Lumbini LOC_Others

. O

According O
to O
sources O
, O
one O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
the O
fatigue O
among O

over O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O

The O

, O
he O
stated O

claimed O
14 O

far O
, O
while O
the O
condition O
of O
six O
of O

Two O
mohalla O
cricketing O
sides O
had O
stepped O
into O
the O
field O
and O
were O
rolling O
out O
the O
mat O
when O
two O
unfamiliar O
, O
clean-shaven O
men O
carrying O
cricket O
kits O
walked O
towards O
them O
. O

For O
a O
moment O
, O
it O
appeared O
two O
cricket O
enthusiasts O
were O
looking O
to O
play O
on O
the O
Police LOC_Event
Public LOC_Event
School LOC_Event
ground LOC_Event
in O
Srinagar LOC_Event
, O
near O
a O
lifeline O
bypass O
connecting O
north O
and O
south LOC_Others
Kashmir LOC_Others
. O

The O
two O
men O
then O
dropped O
the O
kits O
, O
removed O
their O
jackets O
and O
reached O
into O
the O
bags O
. O

Out O
came O
from O
the O
kits O
AK-47 O
guns O
and O
from O
the O
jackets O
ammunition O
. O

By O
the O
time O
the O
guns O
fell O
silent O
after O
30 O
minutes O
, O
five O
CRPF ORG_Victim
jawans O
and O
the O
two O
men O
lay O
dead O
and O
10 O
persons O
, O
including O
three O
young O
players O
, O
were O
injured O
. O

It O
was O
a O
fidayeen O
attack O
, O
the O
first O
in O
Srinagar LOC_Event
in O
over O
three O
years O
and O
executed O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
makes O
every O
normal O
feature O
of O
civilian O
life O
a O
potential O
threat O
to O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

When O
the O
gunfire O
began O
, O
a O
CRPF ORG_Victim
reserve O
party O
was O
killing O
time O
on O
the O
lawns O
, O
several O
jawans O
playing O
cards O
. O

The O
premises O
were O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
in O
Kashmir LOC_Others
because O
the O
school O
is O
sandwiched O
between O
a O
CRPF ORG_Victim
camp O
and O
police O
residential O
quarters O
. O

No O
child O
or O
teacher O
was O
in O
the O
school O
because O
of O
a O
shutdown O
called O
by O
separatists O
to O
seek O
the O
body O
of O
Afzal PER_Accused
Guru PER_Accused
, O
the O
Parliament O
attack O
convict O
who O
was O
hanged O
in O
New LOC_Others
Delhi LOC_Others
on O
February O
16 O
. O

Several O
factors O
that O
swirled O
around O
the O
fidayeen O
attack O
today O
appeared O
to O
suggest O
Afzals O
execution O
has O
made O
Kashmir LOC_Others
a O
deeper O
quagmire O
for O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

The O
CRPF ORG_Victim
reserve O
squad O
was O
awaiting O
deployment O
to O
quell O
the O
citys O
stone-throwing O
protesters O
, O
whose O
ranks O
have O
swelled O
afresh O
after O
the O
hanging O
of O
Afzal PER_Others
. O

The O
attack O
that O
began O
at O
10.45 O
am O
came O
weeks O
after O
top O
militant O
groups O
vowed O
to O
avenge O
the O
execution O
of O
Afzal PER_Others
. O

The O
situation O
on O
the O
ground O
appeared O
so O
inflamed O
that O
some O
protesters O
threw O
stones O
at O
the O
security O
forces O
at O
Bemina LOC_Event
, O
the O
site O
of O
todays O
fidayeen O
attack O
, O
even O
when O
the O
operation O
against O
the O
militants O
was O
in O
progress O
. O

Another O
target O
of O
the O
stones O
was O
a O
CRPF ORG_Victim
vehicle O
ferrying O
back O
from O
hospital O
jawans O
who O
donated O
blood O
for O
those O
injured O
in O
the O
attack O
. O

The O
CRPF ORG_Victim
opened O
fire O
and O
killed O
a O
youth O
, O
inflaming O
passions O
further O
. O

One O
of O
the O
players O
on O
the O
field O
said O
the O
militants O
lobbed O
grenades O
and O
fired O
indiscriminately O
at O
the O
CRPF ORG_Others
jawans O
. O

The O
scenes O
that O
unfolded O
resembled O
signature O
television O
footage O
from O
urban O
conflict O
zones O
uniformed O
forces O
taking O
position O
, O
falling O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
rolling O
over O
, O
firing O
on O
the O
trot O
and O
screaming O
into O
what O
looked O
like O
mobile O
phones O
. O

The O
bodies O
of O
some O
jawans O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
telltale O
sign O
of O
the O
end O
to O
the O
battle O
came O
when O
jawans O
carried O
out O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
militants O
, O
one O
wearing O
a O
red O
outfit O
. O

All O
of O
us O
knelt O
and O
feared O
our O
end O
has O
come O
. O

The O
firing O
and O
explosions O
left O
us O
breathless O
for O
some O
time O
. O

For O
just O
10 O
seconds O
or O
so O
the O
firing O
stopped O
and O
some O
of O
us O
ran O
to O
the O
fence O
, O
climbed O
it O
and O
crossed O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

I O
now O
realise O
it O
was O
madness O
because O
we O
could O
have O
been O
shot O
while O
climbing O
, O
he O
said O
, O
requesting O
not O
to O
be O
named O
. O

On O
record O
, O
the O
players O
all O
in O
the O
early O
twenties O
refused O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
saw O
the O
militants O
, O
probably O
for O
fear O
of O
being O
targeted O
by O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
save O
myself O
and O
my O
friends O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

I O
did O
not O
see O
the O
militants O
entering O
the O
play O
ground O
. O

I O
lost O
my O
senses O
because O
of O
the O
firing O
, O
said O
Obaid PER_Others

one O
of O
the O
injured O
youths O
. O

Mudassir PER_Victim
Wani PER_Victim
, O
who O
was O
also O
injured O
, O
said O
he O
did O
not O
realise O
he O
was O
injured O
possibly O
by O
splinters O
when O
he O
began O
running O
out O
of O
the O
field O
. O

We O
were O
busy O
laying O
the O
mat O
on O
the O
pitch O
and O
blasts O
and O
gunfire O
rang O
out O
. O

We O
fled O
the O
spot O
. O

Some O
people O
came O
to O
my O
rescue O
and O
shifted O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
after O
I O
saw O
blood O
oozing O
from O
my O
foot O
, O

The O
homegrown O
Hizb-ul ORG_Accused

later O
claimed O
responsibility O
, O
though O

suspect O
the O
Pakistan-based O

may O
be O
involved O
. O

A O

identifying O
himself O

the O

told O
a O

out O
the O

A O
police O
officer O
claimed O
both O

To O
be O

to O
the O

rushed O
to O
the O

to O

's O
first O
rally O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

And O
what O
a O
debut O
it O
was.Patna O
's O
historic O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
was O
packed O
to O
the O
brim O
with O
enthusiastic O
supporters O
who O
had O
travelled O
many O
hours O
from O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
state.They O
had O
come O
in O
especially-arranged O
trains O
and O
buses O
and O
had O
walked O
many O
miles O
to O
reach O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
. O

Many O
had O
made O
their O
own O
arrangements O
to O
come O
and O
listen O
to O
a O
man O
who O
had O
so O
far O
been O
denied O
the O
opportunity O
to O
enter O
Bihar LOC_Others
by O
Chief O
Minister O
Nitish O
Kumar.The O
venue O
started O
filling O
up O
from O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
and O
by O
the O
time O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
Chief O
Minister O
arrived O
around O
1 O
pm O
, O
there O
was O
not O
an O
inch O
of O
free O
space.People O
had O
climbed O
onto O
roofs O
and O
terraces O
of O
high O
rise O
buildings O
adjoining O
the O
venue O
. O

They O
had O
even O
jumped O
onto O
Mahatma PER_Others
Gandhi PER_Others
's O
statue O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
ground.Every O
corner O
was O
taken O
. O

And O
as O
Modi PER_Others
was O
walking O
up O
the O
stage O
, O
an O
enthusiastic O
horde O
crashed O
through O
the O
barricades O
and O
entered O
the O
media O
enclosure O
and O
the O
VIP O
area O
. O

Chants O
of O
Modi PER_Others
, O
Modi PER_Others
filled O
the O
air O
, O
quite O
like O
the O
chants O
that O
rally O
for O
Sachin PER_Others
at O
the O
Wankhade O
Stadium.The O
crowd O
latched O
onto O
every O
word O
Modi PER_Others
spoke O
, O
quite O
like O
cricket O
fans O
would O
delight O
at O
every O
stroke O
Sachin PER_Others
played.There O
were O
multiple O
blasts O
near O
the O
venue O
of O
the O
rally O
just O
before O
Modi PER_Others
started O
speaking.At O
first O
they O
sounded O
like O
Diwali O
crackers O
being O
set O
off O
by O
enthusiastic O
supporters O
. O

But O
as O
news O
trickled O
in O
of O
casualties O
, O
tension O
gripped O
the O
air.Local O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
came O
on O
the O
microphone O
and O
tried O
to O
downplay O
the O
explosions O
and O
dismissed O
them O
as O
tyre O
blasts O
and O
firecrackers.The O
crowds O
were O
convinced O
that O
this O
was O
a O
conspiracy O
to O
ruin O
Modi PER_Others
's O
rally.On O
any O
other O
occasion O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
mad O
scramble O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
venue O
and O
a O
stampede O
would O
have O
been O
highly O
likely.But O
despite O
the O
blasts O
, O
which O
saw O
dozens O
of O
injured O
being O
rushed O
to O
nearby O
hospitals O
, O
the O
crowds O
did O
n't O
move O
from O
their O
place.No O
mischief-maker O
was O
going O
to O
come O
between O
the O
crowds O
and O
Modi PER_Others
today.For O
the O
man O
himself O
, O
this O
rally O
was O
special O
. O

He O
had O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

So O
far O
, O
coalition O
dharma O
had O
forced O
him O
to O
lie O
low O
and O
not O
respond O
to O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
's O
constant O
barbs O
against O
him.But O
today O
, O
there O
was O
no O
alliance O
compulsion O
to O
hold O
him O
back O
. O

And O
Modi PER_Others
let O
loose.He O
started O
off O
in O
Bhojpuri LOC_Others
, O
and O
a O
delighted O
crowd O
responded O
with O
wah-wah O
. O

He O
spoke O
of O
Bihari O
pride O
and O
how O
the O
state ORG_Others
government ORG_Others
had O
failed O
to O
create O
jobs O
and O
was O
forcing O
Biharis O
to O
travel O
to O
Gujarat LOC_Others
and O
elsewhere O
in O
search O
of O
employment.But O
the O
main O
target O
of O
Modi PER_Others
's O
speech O
was O
Bihar LOC_Others
chief O
minister O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
, O
a O
leader O
he O
derisively O
referred O
to O
as O
his O
friend.Modi O
called O
Nitish O
and O
opportunist O
and O
hollered O
: O
People O
ask O
me O
why O
my O
friend O
left O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O

I O
tell O
them O
those O
who O
can O
stab O
their O
guru O
Jai PER_Others
Prakash PER_Others
Narayan PER_Others
and O
Ram PER_Others
Manohar PER_Others
Lohia PER_Others
in O
the O
back O
can O
easily O
leave O
their O
long-time O
friend O
BJP ORG_Others
. O

We O
sacrificed O
the O
chance O
of O
Sushil PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
Modi PER_Others
becoming O
the O
chief O
minister O
in O
favour O
of O
my O
friend O
( O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
) O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
clearing O
the O
Jungle O
Raj O
' O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

Nitish PER_Others
did O
n't O
betray O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O

He O
betrayed O
the O
people O
of O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
, O
will O
you O
punish O
those O
people O
who O
betrayed O
you?This O
was O
BJP ORG_Others
's O
PM O
candidate O
Narendra PER_Others
Modi PER_Others
's O
first O
rally O
in O
Bihar.For O
the O
first O
time O
at O
a O
public O
rally O
, O
Modi PER_Others
highlighted O
his O
roots O
as O
a O
chaiwallah O
selling O
tea O
at O
a O
railway LOC_Others
platform LOC_Others
during O
his O
early O
days O
in O
Gujarat.In O
a O
deeply O
casteist O
society O
, O
Modi PER_Others
tried O
to O
play O
up O
his O
credentials O
as O
a O
backward O
leader O
who O
understood O
the O
pain O
of O
the O
impoverished O
, O
unlike O
Rahul PER_Others
Gandhi PER_Others
, O
who O
was O
to O
the O
manor O
born.Congress O
leaders O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
poverty O
and O
hunger O
are O
. O

I O
used O
to O
sell O
tea O
on O
trains O
. O

I O
know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
get O
onto O
trains O
and O
make O
a O
living O
. O

Even O
the O
railway O
minister O
does O
n't O
have O
my O
experience O
of O
the O
problems O
one O
faces O
on O
trains.Modi O
also O
tried O
to O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
Muslims O
of O
Bihar LOC_Others
and O
promised O
them O
development.Our O
Muslim O
brothers O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
are O
so O
backward O
. O

In O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
developing O
regions O
is O
Muslim-dominated O
. O

Let O
Hindus O
and O
Muslims O
together O
and O
work O
towards O
ending O
poverty O
. O

Our O
religion O
is O
India LOC_Others
first O
. O

We O
have O
to O
maintain O
peace O
and O
harmony O
at O
any O
cost.However O
, O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
's O
attempts O
to O
attract O
Muslims O
in O
large O
numbers O
to O
the O
rally O
did O
not O
materialise.Most O
people O
who O
came O
in O
trains O
, O
even O
from O
Muslim O
dominated O
areas O
like O
Kishanganj LOC_Others
, O
were O
Hindus.Muslim O
presence O
at O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
was O
minimal.Gandhi O
Maidan O
has O
seen O
massive O
rallies O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
historic O
rally O
of O
Jai PER_Others

Narain PER_Others
in O
1974 O
, O
in O
which O
he O
gave O

cry O
for O

' O
against O
the O
Indira ORG_Others

here.Also O
, O
Lalu PER_Others
Prasad PER_Others
's O
mega PER_Others
Garib PER_Others
Raila PER_Others
of O
1995 O
, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
have O
attracted O
a O
crowd O
of O
more O
than O
four O
lakh O
people O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
RJD ORG_Others
chief O
's O
popularity O
was O
at O
its O
peak O
in O
Bihar.The O
BJP ORG_Others
is O
claiming O
that O
the O
Hunkar O
Rally O
on O
Sunday O
smashed O
all O
previous O
attendance O
records.Estimates O
vary O
wildly O
. O

By O
conservative O
estimates O
there O
were O
about O
3 O
lakh O
people O
at O
the O
rally O
. O

The O
more O
exuberant O
among O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
say O
more O
than O
10 O
lakh O
people O
attended.The O
real O
number O
may O
lie O
somewhere O
in O
between O
. O

But O
make O
no O
mistake O
, O
Modi PER_Others
sent O
a O
strong O
message O
from O
Gandhi O
Maidan.No O
other O
leader O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
today O
is O
capable O
of O
attracting O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
to O
a O
rally.Most O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
avoid O
the O
maidan O
to O
hide O
their O
inability O
to O
fill O
up O
the O
ground.Most O
of O
the O
people O
who O
attended O
Sunday O
's O
rally O
were O
youngsters O
. O

Many O
were O
first O
time O
voters O
, O
who O
seemed O
more O
attracted O
to O
the O
aura O
of O
Modi PER_Others
than O
they O
were O
to O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
BJP.Whether O
Modi O
can O
live O
up O
to O
the O
expectations O
that O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
built O
up O
is O
not O
known O
. O

But O
the O
youngsters O
who O
gathered O
at O
the O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
seem O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leader O
has O
a O
magic O
wand O
with O
which O
he O
can O
cure O
India O
of O
its O
ills.They O
have O
heard O
of O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
development O
model O
and O
they O
think O
Modi PER_Others
can O
turn O
Bihar LOC_Others
into O
a O
land O
of O
milk O
and O
honey.Modi O
wanted O
a O
show O
of O
strength O
and O
he O
achieved O
that O
goal.But O
the O
real O
test O
is O
to O
see O
if O
Modi PER_Others
can O
convert O
the O
surging O
crowds O
at O
the O
rally O
into O
voters O
during O
the O
general O
