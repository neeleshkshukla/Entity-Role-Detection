They O

It O
was O
only O
during O

was O
discovered O
at O
a O
dry O
port O
in O
the O

of O
Ludhiana LOC_Others

but O
it O
took O
nearly O
six O
years O
to O
start O
the O
process O
of O
disposing O
it O
off O
. O

Bomb O
disposal O
is O
always O
high O
risk O
so O
we O
take O
extra O
precautions O
to O
ensure O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
men O
handling O
the O
ammunition O
, O
the O
villagers O

even O
the O
cattle O
. O

We O
execute O
six O
to O
eight O
blasts O
every O
day O
and O
the O
project O
should O
be O
complete O
in O
two O
months O
. O

The O
sheer O
scale O
of O
the O

has O
given O
us O
a O
chance O

about O
the O
Operation O

The O
operation O
has O
been O
named O
Saiyam O
' O
( O
patience O
) O
. O

We O
have O
been O
trained O
but O
each O
time O
a O
bomb O
is O
picked O
or O
placed O
there O
is O
considerable O
risk O
involved O
, O
that O
is O
why O
the O
remote O
controlled O
vehicles O
, O
telescopic O
handling O
machines O
, O
bomb O
suits O
etc O
are O
used O
, O
if O
proper O
precautions O
are O
taken O
there O
is O
little O
fear O
left O

said O

in O
a O

he O
picked O
a O
rusted O
piece O
of O
metal O
and O
carefully O
placed O
it O
on O
a O
padded O
crane O
. O

The O
scrap O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
recycled O
for O
the O
steel O
industry O
and O
had O
the O
explosives O
gone O
off O
while O
melting O
the O
scrap O
, O
consequences O
would O
have O
been O
catastrophic O
. O

The O
ammunitions O
, O
weighing O
over O
50 O
tonnes O
, O
was O
imported O
into O
the O
country O
in O
the O
garb O
of O
metal O
scrap O
to O
be O
recycled O
into O
steel O
. O

It O
was O
stored O
in O
five O
containers O
, O
four O
of O
which O
were O
20 O
feet O
long O
and O
one O
was O
40 O
feet O
in O
length O
at O
the O
dry O
port O
which O
is O
located O
inside O
a O
populated O
area O
in O
Ludhiana LOC_Others
. O

Operation O
Saiyam O
will O
cost O
about O
Rs O
. O

13.5 O
million O
and O
the O
authorities O
have O
levied O
this O
penalty O
on O
the O
eight O
private O
individuals O
who O
imported O
the O
scrap O
. O

Till O
now O
, O
Army O
officers O
have O
conducted O
over O
60 O
blasts O
and O
destroyed O
over O
1400 O
pieces O
. O

It O
is O
only O
through O
visual O
inspection O
that O
we O
saying O
that O
there O
are O
about O
17,000 O
pieces O
of O
ammunitions O
. O

We O
have O
not O
counted O
them O
physically O
. O

The O
number O
can O
go O
up O
when O
we O
take O
actual O
stock O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
, O
he O
said O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
tedious O
process O
and O
consumes O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Our O
officers O
can O
not O
rush O
things O
and O
they O
have O
to O
be O
very O
patient O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
keep O
rotating O
our O
officers O
on O
different O
jobs O
so O
that O
monotony O
does O
not O
set O
in O

first O
so O
that O
the O

can O
be O
rehabilitates O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
the O
cooperation O
of O
the O
villagers O
is O
very O
important O
, O
we O
have O
12 O
police O
posts O
to O
ensure O
that O
once O
the O

begin O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
around O
the O

and O
until O
we O
are O
left O
with O
very O
small O

, O
we O
wo O
n't O
take O
any O

Mr. O
Bhushan PER_Others
pleaded O
for O
granting O
Mr. O
Maudany PER_Accused
bail O
on O
medical O
grounds O
as O
he O
was O
suffering O
from O
several O
ailments O
. O

He O
asserted O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
against O
him O
and O
that O
he O
had O
been O
falsely O
implicated O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
some O
statements O
given O
by O
the O
co-accused O
before O
the O
police O
, O
and O
which O
was O
not O
admissible O
as O

He O
alleged O
that O
the O
State O
government O
due O
to O
political O
and O
communal O
reasons O
had O
implicated O
Mr. O

as O
he O

of O
the O
Muslim O

Mr. O
Andhyarujina PER_Others

however O

the O

not O

also O
in O
the O

He O
said O
the O
other O
accused O
had O
clearly O
stated O
the O
role O
played O
by O
Mr. O
Maudany PER_Accused
, O
which O
was O
reflected O
by O
the O
telephone O
calls O
he O
made O
to O
the O
other O
accused O
before O
and O
after O
the O
bomb O

. O

His O
release O
on O

would O
pose O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O

he O
was O

there O
was O
no O
material O
to O
implicate O
Mr. O
Maudany PER_Accused
and O
that O
he O
could O
be O
granted O

He O
cited O
the O
instance O
of O
the O
Supreme ORG_Others

releasing O
Dr. O

on O

, O
though O
the O

and O
the O
High ORG_Others
Court ORG_Others
took O
a O
different O
view O
. O

Justice O
Katju PER_Others
said O
that O
since O
the O
police O
were O
not O
scientifically O
trained O
to O
deal O
with O
serious O
crimes O
, O
they O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
falsely O

Stating O
that O
no O

could O
be O
drawn O
with O
Dr. O

, O
Mr. O

: O
Please O

no O

The O
case O

We O
are O
all O
proud O
of O
that O

This O
case O

The O
man O
Maudany PER_Accused
has O
been O
accused O
of O

over O
100 O

You O
can O
not O

Justice O

did O
not O
accept O
the O
contention O
of O
Mr. O

said O
: O
If O
your O

that O

arrest O

on O
the O

of O

made O

no O

We O

that O
no O

You O
have O
to O

that O

around O
eight O

We O
have O
come O
across O
the O

only O
in O
the O
range O
of O
one O
to O
two O
kg O
. O

But O
this O
is O
huge O
, O
he O
added O
. O

The O
explosive O
, O
packed O
in O
a O
PVC O
pipe O
, O
was O
placed O
in O
one O
of O

two O

at O
Alampatti LOC_Event
on O

Since O
the O

was O

, O
the O
suspects O
connected O
the O
explosive-packed O
( O
four-foot-long O
) O
PVC O
pipe O
with O
an O
empty O

( O

The O

The O

was O

on O
the O
downstream O

the O

. O

There O
were O
lot O
of O

on O
the O
upstream O

Probably O
, O
they O
avoided O
it O
because O
the O
bush O
that O
would O
have O
provided O
them O
a O
good O

While O
the O

was O
placed O

the O
farther O

the O
causeway O
, O
the O
trigger O
was O
placed O
closer O
to O
the O
entry O
to O
the O
causeway O
. O

It O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
farther O

since O
the O
conspirators O

plan O
was O
to O
get O
maximum O

a O
destructive O

highly O

practice O

to O
the O

Though O

this O

According O

2 O

4 O

Some O

The O
idea O
is O
to O
create O
shockwaves O
under O

to O
stun O
the O

damage O
their O

According O
to O
the O
team O
of O
doctors O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
nails O
have O
been O
embedded O
in O
the O
victim O

bodies O
, O
some O
of O
them O
being O
lodged O
quite O
precariously O
making O
the O
treatment O
challenging O
. O

One O
such O
case O
is O
that O
of O
37-year-old O
blast O
victim O
Nitin PER_Victim
, O
who O
is O
presently O
undergoing O
treatment O
at O
the O
Trauma O
Centre O
of O
RML ORG_Others
Hospital ORG_Others
. O

Operated O
upon O
his O
right O
thigh O
for O
removal O
of O
a O
foreign O
body O
, O
he O
is O
stable O
and O
recovering O
fast O
. O

What O
makes O
his O
case O
unique O
according O
to O
the O
doctors O
is O
that O
he O
had O
over O
a O
thousand O
pellet O
injuries O
with O
shrapnels O
embedded O
all O
over O
his O
body O
including O
his O
face O
. O

He O
was O
critical O
and O
admitted O
to O
the O
ICU O
, O
but O
has O
now O
been O
shifted O
to O
the O
emergency O
orthopaedic O
ward O
. O

The O
doctors O
attending O
them O
have O
been O
conducting O
surgeries O
to O
remove O
some O
of O
the O
splinters O
. O

However O
, O
the O
medicos O
admit O
that O
few O
pellets O
will O
remain O
inside O
the O
body O
as O
taking O
them O
out O
may O
prove O
to O
be O
risky O
. O

Dr O
Sunil PER_Others
Saxena PER_Others
said O
: O
He O
is O
a O
very O
cheerful O
guy O
and O
is O
recovering O
well O
but O
being O
young O
he O
was O
extremely O
conscious O
of O
the O
shrapnel O
injuries O
on O
his O
face O
and O
wanted O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
those O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

We O
told O
him O
the O
scars O
would O
gradually O
go O
away O
and O
the O
rest O
can O
be O
camouflaged O
with O
a O
beard O
. O

His O
entire O
body O
is O
covered O
with O
such O
shrapnels O
unlike O
other O
cases O
where O
shrapnels O
got O
lodged O
only O
in O
some O
body O
parts O
. O

The O
good O
thing O
about O
shrapnels O
is O
that O
they O
get O
sterile O
due O
to O
the O
extremely O
high O
temperature O
during O
the O
blast O
and O
hence O
pose O
no O
infection O
threat O
to O
the O
patient O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
for O
these O
splinters O
to O
be O
dislodged O
unless O
they O
are O
jutting O
out O
or O
they O
get O
lodged O
in O
an O
artery O
affecting O
blood O
flow O
. O

Usually O
, O
a O
connective O
tissue O
develops O
around O
them O
and O
they O
get O
encapsulated O
in O
the O
skin O
covering O
them O
, O
he O
added O
. O

Aware O
of O
the O
possible O
difficulties O
of O
living O
with O
pellets O
, O
Dr O
Saxena PER_Others
added O
, O
If O
needed O
, O
we O
will O
provide O
such O
patients O
with O
a O
medical O
card O
that O
will O
identify O
them O
as O
a O
person O
who O
has O
embedded O
metal O
parts O
in O
his O
body O
. O

This O
will O
help O
them O
during O
electronic O
frisking O
at O
airports O
and O
other O
places O

status O
but O
requests O
them O
not O

Another O
queer O
case O
is O
that O
of O
55-year-old O
Pramod PER_Victim
Kumar PER_Victim
Mahindera PER_Victim
whose O
thigh O
has O
been O
embedded O

a O

the O

of O
the O

He O
has O
suffered O
fractures O
in O
both O
bones O
in O
his O
right O
leg O
and O
is O
stable O
now O
while O
recovering O
at O
the O
Trauma O
Centre O
unit O
of O
RML ORG_Others
. O

Dr O
Saxena PER_Others
said O
: O
His O
case O
does O
not O
require O
surgical O
intervention O
if O
the O
nail O
is O
not O
disturbed O
but O
in O
case O
pressure O
is O
applied O
to O
the O
part O
, O
surgery O
would O
be O
needed O
as O
things O
might O
get O
complicated O

the O

the O

Initially O
the O

said O
the O

left O

with O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O

the O

At O

20 O
people O
sustained O

several O

the O

a O
high O

was O
used O
along O

some O

enhance O
its O
effect O

It O
ripped O

However O
, O
the O
police O
are O
yet O
to O
clarify O
if O
a O

was O
used O
in O
the O
device O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
splinters O
were O
not O
used O
in O
the O
bomb O
suggests O
that O
it O
was O
a O
specific-target O

The O
aim O
was O
to O
target O
the O

the O

the O

could O
be O

It O
is O

Police O
investigating O
the O

twin O
blasts O
received O
a O
shot O
in O
the O
arm O
on O
Wednesday O
when O
they O

upon O
the O
video O
footage O
of O
a O
purported O
suspect O
recorded O
by O
surveillance O
cameras O
of O
a O
noted O
cloth O
store O

The O
footage O
is O
of O
high O
quality O
, O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
suspects O
face O
does O
not O
figure O
in O
it O
. O

Yet O
police O
hope O
it O
will O
help O
them O
to O
narrow O
down O
the O
suspects O
by O
preparing O
portrait O
parley O

-- O
vis O
video O
footages O
recorded O
by O
other O

. O

The O
suspect O
in O
the O
cloth-store O
cameras O
video O
footage O
was O
seen O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
but O
most O
of O
the O
time O
his O
back O
was O
towards O
the O
camera O
, O
a O
police O
officer O
said O
. O

Not O
leaving O
anything O
to O
chance O
, O
police O
had O
collected O
video O
footage O
captured O
by O
different O
cameras O
in O
and O
around O
Dilsukhnagar LOC_Event
. O

An O
analysis O
of O
the O
visuals O
indicated O
that O
the O
bomb O
planters O
came O
from O
either O
the O
Gaddiannaram O
side O
or O
the O
lane O
near O
the O
Dilsukhnagar LOC_Others
bus LOC_Others
depot LOC_Others
. O

These O
images O
raise O
suspicion O
if O
the O
tall O
man O
, O
wearing O
a O
pair O
of O
white O
socks O
and O
black O
shoes O
, O
who O
was O
seen O
always O
keeping O
his O
right O
hand O
in O
his O
pants O
pocket O
, O
used O
a O
remote O
control O
device O
to O
detonate O
the O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
( O
IEDs O
) O
. O

Our O
conjecture O
is O
a O
timer O
was O
used O
to O
explode O
the O
IEDs O
, O
but O
the O
possibility O
of O
using O
the O
remote O
control O
device O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
, O
forensic O
experts O
remarked O
. O

They O
are O
sure O
it O
is O
not O
akin O
to O
the O
TV O
remote O
control O
device O
, O
which O
is O
made O
with O
infra O
red O
technology O
. O

For O
this O
, O
the O
line O
of O
sight O
joining O
the O
target O
and O
the O
control O
device O
is O
compulsory O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
chances O
are O
there O
that O
the O
radiofrequency O
signal O
technology O
adopted O
in O
cars O
to O
make O
remote O
control O
operations O
can O
be O
used O
to O
trigger O
a O
bomb O
. O

It O
can O
be O
operated O
from O
a O
distance O
of O
even O
500 O
meters O
if O
a O
high-quality O
transmitter O
and O
antennas O
are O
used O
, O
experts O
maintained O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
so O
far O
police O
have O
not O
found O
any O
trace O
of O
evidence O
confirming O
that O
a O
timer O
was O
used O
for O
triggering O
the O
blasts O
. O

Investigators O
are O
yet O
to O
find O
traces O
of O
any O
of O
these O
to O
conclusively O
say O
that O
a O
timer O
mechanism O
was O
used O
for O
the O
detonation O
of O
IEDs O
. O

When O
the O
going O
gets O
tough O
, O
the O
tough O
gets O
going O

says O
an O
old O
clich O

But O
when O
the O
twin O

rocked O

spread O
waves O

shock O

panic O
, O
undeterred O

The O

such O
that O

exploded O
outside O
a O
popular O

the O

In O
a O

a O
few O
hours O
after O
the O

, O
President O

seemed O
to O
be O
conscious O
of O
the O

of O
suspicion O
that O
followed O
9/11 O
, O
particularly O
the O
violent O

against O
Muslims O

We O

all O

We O
still O
do O

jump O

before O
we O
have O
all O
the O

Yet O
even O
as O
he O
spoke O
there O
were O
unconfirmed O
reports O
in O
the O

about O
a O
Saudi O
national O
said O
to O

at O

Some O

got O
ahead O

themselves O
, O
speculating O
over O
whether O

could O
be O

Yet O
as O
of O
Tuesday O
, O
the O

made O
it O
clear O
they O
had O
no O
concrete O

After O
nearly O
a O

of O

the O

such O
as O
the O

it O
is O
only O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
that O
the O
U.S. ORG_Others
has O
enacted O
stronger O
protections O
for O

There O
is O
a O
real O

that O
Mondays O

Mr. O

the O

may O
lead O

the O

If O
they O
do O
, O
it O
may O
once O
again O
draw O
the O
U.S. ORG_Others
back O
into O
a O
negative O
spiral O
of O

in O

those O
making O
their O

may O
have O
felt O
nothing O
but O
a O

Yet O
, O
as O
they O
approached O
the O

at O
2.45 O
p.m. O
on O

the O

Soon O

it O

reported O
that O
a O
motorcycle O
with O
Tamil LOC_Others

registration O
number O
was O
used O
to O
trigger O
the O

. O

Though O
the O
registration O
number O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
fake O
one O
, O
the O
State O
police O
, O
relying O
on O
the O

provided O
by O

managed O
to O
track O
down O
the O
registered O
owner O
of O
the O

on O
the O

. O

However O
, O
he O
claimed O
to O
have O
sold O
the O
motorcycle O
to O
someone O
else O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
investigators O
came O
across O
several O
fake O
names O

A O

the O
name O
, O
identity O
proof O

provided O
by O
them O
were O
found O
to O
be O
fake O

It O
appears O
that O
the O

changed O

only O
to O

Doctors O
there O
wondered O
if O
he O
was O
really O
one O
of O
the O

They O
thought O
I O
was O
an O
impostor O

were O
not O
convinced O
even O
when O
I O
showed O
my O
discharge O

from O

I O

, O
gritting O

he O

They O
were O
stumped O

they O
never O
received O
such O
a O

I O
was O
told O
that O
only O
one O
FIR O
had O
been O

for O

based O
on O
which O
the O
investigation O
is O
going O
on O
and O
it O
had O
no O
names O

The O
best O
they O
can O
do O
is O
furnishing O
a O
letter O
that O
I O
was O
indeed O
a O
victim O
, O
he O
says O
. O

Mohan PER_Victim
returned O

to O
seek O

had O
already O
left O

he O
continues O
to O
wait O
for O
the O

If O

The O

The O
58th O

thus O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
tragic O
affair O
for O
the O

as O
mostly O
women O

just O
five O
minutes O

of O
the O

time O
of O

. O

The O
blast O
was O
so O
powerful O
that O
it O
caused O
a O
huge O
crate O
at O
the O
spot O
. O

The O
blast O
occurred O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
students O
and O
teachers O
of O
various O
schools O
were O
passing O
through O
the O
gate O

The O
district O

directed O
all O

bring O
their O

for O
the O
Independence O

Though O
no O
militant O
outfit O
has O
so O
far O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
the O
blast O
, O
it O
is O
widely O
believed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
handiwork O
of O
the O
United ORG_Accused
Liberation ORG_Accused

of ORG_Accused
Assam ORG_Accused
( O
ULFA ORG_Accused

. O

The O

was O
involved O
in O
several O
acts O
of O
violence O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
state O
in O
the O
run-up O
to O
the O
Independence O

A O
bomb O
was O
exploded O
in O
Dhakuakhana LOC_Event
at O
around O
8 O
a O
m O
on O
the O
same O
day O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
no O
one O
was O
injured O
. O

But O
the O
police O
failed O
to O
take O
adequate O
preventive O
measures O
to O
protect O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
innocent O
women O
and O
children O
in O
the O
state O
. O

That O
the O
blast O
at O
Dhakuakhana LOC_Event
failed O
to O
ring O
the O
alarm O
bells O
in O
Dhamaji LOC_Event
shows O
the O
sorry O
state O
of O
police O
alertness O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
ULFA ORG_Accused
admitted O
, O
in O
an O
oblique O
manner O
, O
that O
the O
Dhemaji LOC_Event
blast O
was O
its O
handiwork O
. O

In O
a O
statement O
issued O
on O

, O
the O
self-styled O
chairman O
of O
the O
banned O
outfit O
, O
Arabinda PER_Others
Rajkhowa PER_Others
, O
stated O
that O
the O

were O
used O
as O
a O
shield O
by O
the O
Indian ORG_Others
occupation ORG_Others

its O

to O
defy O

organisation O
which O
has O
been O
engaging O
itself O
to O
uphold O
the O
popular O
interest O
despite O
military O
repression O
. O

The O
blast O
in O
Dhemaji LOC_Event
within O
a O
supposedly O
secure O
zone O
was O
clearly O
the O
result O
of O
major O
security O
lapses O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
police O
and O
the O
local O
administration O
. O

The O
declarations O
made O
by O
officials O
that O
all O
possible O
security O
measures O
had O
been O
taken O
were O
proved O
to O
be O
false O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O

lost O
no O
time O
in O
ordering O
the O
suspension O
of O

SP O

, O
as O
well O

the O

of O
the O

, O
indicates O
a O
desperate O
governmental O
damage-control O
and O
public O

exercise O
. O

It O
is O
also O
an O
admission O
that O
those O
assigned O

such O

from O
taking O

had O
failed O
in O

in O

at O

no O
room O
for O

as O

This O
is O
the O
ideal O

on O
the O
strategy O
and O
strength O
of O
the O

some O

In O

, O
the O
authors O
of O
this O
piece O
( O

published O
predictions O
of O
IM ORG_Accused
attacks O
in O
the O
last O

These O
predictions O
were O
proved O

by O
the O

in O
Patna LOC_Others

But O
a O
subsequent O
prediction O
by O
the O
authors O
in O
January O
2014 O
forecasting O
attacks O
by O
IM ORG_Accused
during O
the O
January-May O
2014 O
time O
frame O
has O
thus O
far O
been O
proven O
wrong O
although O
not O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
effort O
by O
IM ORG_Accused
to O
carry O
out O
attacks O
that O
disrupt O
the O
elections O
. O

Indians O
can O
be O

for O
the O
extraordinary O
work O
by O
Indian ORG_Others

organizations ORG_Others
in O
preventing O

plots O
from O
being O
successful O
. O

. O

. O

In O
the O
last O
quarter O
of O
2013 O
, O
Indian O
security O
officials O
were O
able O
to O
make O
several O
key O
arrests O
of O
IM ORG_Accused
operatives O
. O

In O
early O
November O
, O
following O
the O
attack O
on O
Modis O
election O
rally O
in O
Patna LOC_Others
, O
several O
IM ORG_Accused

were O
arrested O

as O
well O
as O
a O
few O
IM ORG_Accused
men O
were O
also O
arrested O
in O
December O
2013 O
. O

A O
predictive O
behavioral O
model O
of O
IM ORG_Accused
attacks O
suggested O
that O
IM ORG_Accused
often O
carries O
out O
attacks O
on O
public O
sites O
( O
usually O
markets O
) O
a O
few O
months O
after O
arrests O
of O
some O
IM ORG_Accused
members O
. O

. O

. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
November O
2013 O
, O
IM ORG_Accused
released O
video O

and O
imagery O
of O
the O
Babri ORG_Others
Masjid ORG_Others
demolition O
and O
the O
post-Godhra O

in O

the O
goal O
of O
these O
releases O
may O
have O
been O
to O
inflame O
Indian O
Muslim O
sentiment O
or O
to O
encourage O
IM ORG_Accused
operatives O
. O

The O
behavioral O
model O
of O
IM ORG_Accused
found O
that O
, O
when O
IM ORG_Accused
engages O
in O
a O
publicity O
campaign O
, O
attacks O
follow O
a O
few O
months O
later O
. O

Attacks O
by O
IM ORG_Accused
also O
follow O
about O
half O
a O
year O
after O
any O
signs O
of O
improvements O
in O
Indo-Pak O
diplomatic O
relations O

These O
data-points O
led O

predict O
impending O
attacks O
in O
the O
January-May O
2014 O

It O
is O
now O

carry O
out O
several O
such O

Indias O
Muslims O
from O
the O
Hindu O
majority O
. O

An O
attack O
during O
the O
current O
election O
period O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
not O
only O
disrupt O
the O
free O
and O
fair O
conduct O
of O
the O
elections O
, O
but O
also O
to O
trigger O
an O
avalanche O
of O
communal O
violence O
. O

For O
IM ORG_Accused
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
self-fulfilling O
prophecy O
, O
giving O
them O
further O
impetus O
to O
spread O
their O
radical O
message O
and O
expanding O
their O
appeal O
. O

While O
IM ORG_Accused
radicalism O
has O
had O
only O
miniscule O
appeal O
to O
Indias O
Muslim O
population O
, O
a O
well-organized O
and O
sponsored O
terrorist O
group O
requires O
only O
a O
relatively O
small O
cadre O
to O
spread O
enormous O
havoc O
. O

. O

. O

Thus O
, O
disrupting O
all O
potential O
terrorist O
plots O
has O
been O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
Indian O
security O
establishment O
one O
that O
they O
have O
carried O
out O
spectacularly O
well O
. O

In O
just O
the O
past O
two O
months O
, O
at O
least O
five O
IM ORG_Accused
plots O
have O
reportedly O
been O
disrupted O
by O
Indian ORG_Others
police ORG_Others
, O
including O
highly O
symbolic O
operations O
against O
the O
Red LOC_Others
Fort LOC_Others
, O
specific O
operations O
against O
tourism-related O
targets O
, O
and O
specific O
operations O
against O
religious O
events O
. O

All O
of O
these O
had O
the O
potential O
to O
both O
exacerbate O
communal O
tensions O
as O
well O
as O
energize O
IMs O
cadres O
. O

. O

. O

The O
law O
enforcement O
success O
to O
date O
must O
not O
lead O
to O
complacency O
not O
only O
between O
now O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
election O
results O
but O
beyond O
. O

Weakened O
terrorist O
groups O
can O
be O
very O
dangerous O
, O
as O
they O
seek O
to O
rally O
their O
supporters O
( O
and O
in O
the O
case O
of O

show O
their O
continued O

) O
with O

strive O
to O
show O
that O

capable O
of O
executing O
deadly O
terror O

Reports O
of O

intended O

are O
particularly O
worrisome O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
Rajasthan LOC_Others

Odisha LOC_Others
have O
been O
` O
hibernating O
grounds O
' O
for O
IM ORG_Accused
militants O
, O
where O
IM ORG_Accused
has O
focused O
on O
building O
sleeper O
cells O
and O
engaged O
in O
recruitment O
and O
fund-raising O
activities O
, O
while O
generally O
carrying O
out O
relatively O
few O
attacks O
. O

If O
, O
as O
it O
appears O
, O
IM ORG_Accused
has O
chosen O
to O
activate O
their O
sleeper O
cells O
in O
these O
States O
, O
potentially O
jeopardizing O
their O
safe O
heavens O
, O
it O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
greater O
intelligence O
gathering O
and O
security O
sweeps O
are O
called O
for O
. O

. O

. O

Considering O
IMs O
powerful O
sponsors O
, O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
organization O
has O
been O
de-fanged O
. O

Beyond O
maintaining O
their O
vigilance O
, O
Indian O
security O
forces O
should O
also O
continue O
to O
pursue O
the O
organizational O
reforms O

counter-terrorism O
. O

Expanding O
intelligence O
capabilities O
to O
better O
collect O
, O
analyze O

intelligence O
is O
crucial O
. O

Improved O
intelligence O
cooperation O
between O
agencies O
at O
the O
federal O

levels O
is O
particularly O
important O
in O
connecting O

Indias O

have O
had O
remarkable O
successes O
recently O
, O
but O
an O
enduring O
lesson O
of O
counter-terrorism O
is O
that O

are O

said O
the O
sketch O
had O
been O
prepared O
with O
the O
help O

inputs O
provided O
by O
three O
eyewitnesses O
. O

They O
told O
police O
that O
the O
suspect O
, O
along O
with O
two O
or O
three O
of O
his O
accomplices O
, O
had O
boarded O
the O
train O
with O
a O
cloth O
bag O
but O
alighted O
soon O
after O
. O

While O
alighting O
, O
he O
apparently O
did O
not O
have O
the O
cloth O
bag O
- O
in O
which O
he O
is O
said O
to O
have O
carried O
the O
explosive O
- O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

The O
police O
officer O
said O
that O
in O
all O
there O
were O
perhaps O
four O
young O
men O
of O
similar O
appearance O
present O
in O
the O
compartment O
a O
little O
before O
the O
explosions O
took O
place O
. O

`` O
Since O
they O
are O
not O
among O
the O
injured O
, O
nor O
among O
the O
eyewitnesses O
, O
we O
gather O
that O
they O
could O
have O
been O
responsible O
for O
the O
incident O

that O

there O

But O
while O
the O
involvement O
of O
local O
jihadi O
groups O
is O
being O
ruled O
out O
, O
the O
police O
were O
categorical O
in O
bringing O
to O
light O
the O
international O
links O
. O

They O
pointed O
out O
that O
Hanif PER_Accused
, O
who O
is O
clearly O
the O
mastermind O
and O
key O
agent O
of O
the O
blast O
, O
was O
employed O
at O
the O
Hilton ORG_Others
Hotel ORG_Others
in O
Dubai LOC_Accused
as O
an O
electrician O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

The O
police O
said O
that O
after O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
riots O
, O
he O
was O
` O
indoctrinated O
' O
in O
Dubai LOC_Accused
and O
returned O
to O
India LOC_Event
on O
September O
14 O
, O
2002 O
, O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
carrying O
out O
terrorist O
acts O
. O

On O
his O
return O
to O
India LOC_Event
, O
Hanif PER_Accused
contacted O
Ashraf PER_Accused
and O
the O
duo O
began O
carrying O
out O
the O
explosions O
, O
supported O
by O
Hanif PER_Accused
's O
wife O
and O
grown-up O
daughter O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

When O
asked O
who O
indoctrinated O
him O
, O
the O
police O
were O
unwilling O
to O
give O
a O
name O
or O
even O
a O
hint O
. O

But O
the O
aforementioned O
officer O
said O
that O
as O
per O
their O
information O
, O
they O
believe O
that O
the O
Dubai LOC_Accused
centre O
that O
` O
indoctrinated O
' O
Hanif O
received O
instructions O
from O
an O
outfit O
in O
Saudi LOC_Others
Arabia LOC_Others
, O
which O
in O
turn O
was O
commanded O
by O
an O
outfit O
in O
Pakistan LOC_Others
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

This O
officer O
said O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
Lashkar-e-Tayiba ORG_Others
was O
not O
ruled O
out O
, O
just O
that O
it O
was O
more O
roundabout O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

But O
what O
stands O
punctured O
is O
the O
so-called O
link O
between O
the O
Lashkar ORG_Others
and O
SIMI ORG_Others
, O
a O
link O
that O
had O
political O
overtones O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

ASHRAF PER_Accused
told O

that O
they O
had O
formed O

to O
avenge O
the O
killings O
of O

Ashraf O

worker O
, O
based O
in O
Surat LOC_Accused
, O
southern O
Gujarat LOC_Others

But O
while O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
riots O
affected O
Ahmedabad LOC_Others
, O
Vadodara LOC_Others
and O
central O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
Surat LOC_Accused
was O
peaceful O
. O

So O
on O
what O
basis O
did O
Ashraf PER_Accused
claim O
to O
be O
affected O
? O
. O

. O

. O

. O

A O
second O
senior O
officer O
told O
rediff.com ORG_Others
that O
when O
Ashraf PER_Accused
was O
questioned O
why O
Mumbai LOC_Event
is O
being O
targeted O
if O
the O
motive O
is O
revenge O
for O
Gujarat LOC_Others
, O
he O
apparently O
replied O
, O
` O
Because O
the O
rich O
supporters O
of O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
government O
are O
all O
based O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O

' O
. O

. O

. O

. O

But O
a O
third O
senior O
police O
officer O
said O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O
, O
Gujarat LOC_Others
was O
merely O
the O
fig O
leaf O
cover O
. O

` O
Gujarat LOC_Others
today O
is O
being O
blamed O
for O
everything O
, O
' O
he O
said O
, O
` O
It O
is O
too O
simple O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
only O
motive O
is O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O

It O
is O
like O
saying O
that O
if O
Gujarat LOC_Others
did O
not O
happen O
then O
these O
blasts O
would O
not O
take O
place O
. O

But O
we O
know O
that O
would O
not O
be O
the O
case O
. O

These O
blasts O
are O
going O
to O
occur O
because O
the O
motive O
is O
far O
bigger O
. O

' O
. O

. O

. O

. O

There O
has O
been O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
Gujarat LOC_Others
revenge O
motive O
is O
being O
played O
to O
the O
hilt O
. O

When O
the O
blast O
occurred O
, O
Bhujbal PER_Others
's O
first O
reaction O
then O
was O
to O
blame O
the O
blasts O
on O
Gujarat LOC_Others
. O

Reason O
: O
all O
the O
blasts O
had O
occurred O
in O
Gujarati-dominated O
areas O
such O
as O
Ghatkopar LOC_Others
and O
Zaveri LOC_Event
Bazar LOC_Event
. O

The O
Gateway LOC_Event
of LOC_Event
India LOC_Event
is O
an O
international O
symbol O
and O
a O
favourite O
tourist O
spot O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

But O
as O
the O
police O
revealed O
, O
the O
explosive O
for O
the O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event
blast O
was O
placed O
inside O
the O
bus O
at O
Andheri LOC_Accused
East LOC_Accused
, O
from O
where O
the O
bus O
begins O
its O
run O
, O
and O
timed O
to O
explode O
later O
. O

It O
was O
just O
a O
coincidence O
that O
it O
happened O
to O
be O
Ghatkopar LOC_Event
. O

And O
Zaveri LOC_Event
Bazar LOC_Event
is O
one O
of O
Mumbai LOC_Event
's O
most O
important O
commercial O
areas O
, O
and O
an O
extremely O
congested O
and O
busy O
area O
, O
where O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
slip O
in O
and O
out O
without O
anyone O
noticing O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

The O
police O
also O
said O
that O
the O

All O
the O

were O
in O
the O

carry O
middle O

apart O

Thus O
, O
the O
target-segment O
was O
chosen O
carefully O
to O
break O
the O
middle O
layer O
of O

This O
can O
not O
be O
blindly O
termed O
as O
an O
intelligence O
failure O
. O

In O
any O
city O

Mumbai LOC_Event

with O

it O
is O

The O

is O
rarely O

only O
when O

7 O

leads O
to O

we O
can O
say O

three-sigma O

This O
7 O

Four-sigma O

will O
make O
it O
99.4 O

I O
believe O
, O
the O
intelligence O
quality O
may O
lie O
somewhere O
between O
3.5 O
sigma O
and O
4 O
sigma O
. O

At O
less O
than O
this O
mark O
, O
we O
would O
have O
seen O
many O
more O
such O
horrible O
incidents O
. O

. O

. O

IT O
infrastructure O
could O
be O
the O
next O
target O
. O

. O

If O
the O
methods O
used O
by O
terrorist O
since O
1993 O
till O
2006 O
are O
analysed O
, O
one O
can O
see O
the O
trend O
that O
the O
attacks O
are O
becoming O
more O
sophisticated O
with O
precisely O
defined O
targets O
using O
the O
same O
old O
tools O
. O

The O
arrests O
of O
some O
terrorists O
in O
the O
recent O
past O
revealed O
that O
terrorists O
are O
recruiting O
people O
trained O
in O
engineering O
, O
science O
, O
medicine O
and O
management O
. O

. O

. O

A O
lot O
of O
technical O
and O
managerial O
knowledge O
is O
flowing O
in O
to O
the O
terror O
industry O
. O

It O
seems O
clear O
that O
at O
least O
the O
planning O
process O
is O
done O
by O
technical O
and O
managerial O
educated O
minds O
. O

. O

. O

In O
this O
scenario O
, O
the O
risk O
is O
very O
high O
that O
IT O
infrastructure O
and O
IT O
assets O
may O
be O
targetted O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
softest O
targets O
today O
, O
which O
can O
create O
maximum O
damage O
. O

. O

. O

Today O
, O
the O
application O
and O
implementation O
of O
IT O
controls O
many O
business O
processes O
of O
social O
and O
national O
strategic O
importance O
-- O
power O
, O
communication O
, O
railways O
, O
transport O
, O
oil O
, O
manufacturing O
, O
banking O
, O
services O
, O
government-business O
, O
etc. O
. O

The O
security O
of O
these O
IT O
assets O
and O
IT O
infrastructure O
is O
far O
lower O
compared O
to O
the O
security O
of O
normal O
physical O
assets/infrastructure O
. O

Hackers O
, O
perpetrators O
, O
computer-criminals O
easily O
break O
into O
IT O
assets O
and O
create O
news O
. O

. O

. O

There O
are O
many O
methods O
available O
for O
terrorists O
to O
break O
into O
this O
IT O
infrastructure O
/ O
IT O
assets O
. O

I O
can O
discuss O
a O
number O
of O
these O
. O

But O
the O
irony O
is O
that O
this O
discussion O
of O
methods O
apart O
from O
creating O
awareness O
among O
masses O
, O
will O
also O
help O
terrorist O
get O
ideas O
. O

I O
refrain O
from O
discussing O
these O
methods O
as O
a O
better O
and O
socially O
secure O
option O
. O

. O

. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
all O
concerned O
business-process O
owners O
, O
whether O
in O
government O
or O
industry O
or O
utilities O
, O
to O
ascertain O
that O
their O
IT O
assets O
and O
infrastructure O
are O
reasonably O
secure O
. O

. O

. O

Security O
is O
not O
a O
one-time O
event O
. O

Security O
is O
a O
continuous O
process O
. O

Security O
is O
constant O
vigilance O
. O

Security O
is O
an O
ongoing O
fight O
between O
evil O
and O
our-protection-from-evil O
. O

. O

. O

Evil O
always O
finds O
new O
ways O
to O
attack O
us O
. O

So O
it O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
keep O
a O
constant O
vigil O
and O
keep O
upgrading O
the O
methods O
and O
technology O
of O
securing O
ourselves O
. O

Especially O
, O
when O
the O
threat O
is O
apparent O
and O
looming O
large O
on O
the O
horizon O
. O

. O

. O

The O
spirit O
of O
Mumbai LOC_Event

. O

Today O
, O
Mumbai LOC_Event
is O
back O
to O
business O

People O
suffered O
a O

on O

, O
but O
only O
after O
12 O

15 O
hours O
they O
are O
back O
to O
their O
duties/business O
without O
any O
fear O
, O
travelling O
in O
the O
same O
crowded O
trains O
. O

This O
is O
the O
spirit O
of O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O

Terrorists O
can O
explode O
bombs O
in O

or O
even O
at O
strategic O
locations O
, O
but O
they O
can O
not O
break O
the O
Mumbai LOC_Event
spirit O
. O

. O

. O

This O
spirit O
is O
sufficient O
to O
frustrate O
the O
evil O
design O
of O
terror-mongers O
. O

They O
can O
draw O
satisfaction O
from O
material O

they O
are O
unable O
to O
break O
the O
moral O
, O

of O

Despite O

Critics O

feel O
that O
the O
unsatisfactory O

it O
clear O
to O

that O
while O
there O
is O
no O
question O
of O

the O
law O
has O
to O
take O
its O
own O
course O
against O
those O
indulging O

has O
contributed O
to O
the O
anger O
in O
large O
sections O
of O
the O
Hindu O
community O
against O

has O
been O
a O
deplorable O
attempt O
by O
some O
leaders O

to O
create O
a O
divide O
between O
the O

The O

It O

it O
can O
help O

it O
raises O
serious O
questions O
about O
the O

According O

the O
key O

it O
was O

the O
last O
straw O

to O
make O

The O

The O

also O
asked O

to O
remain O
on O
high O
alert.Though O
officials O
remained O
tight-lipped O
, O
they O
hinted O
that O
the O
blasts O
appeared O
to O
be O
the O
handiwork O
of O
local O

who O
used O
locally O
available O
explosives O
-LRB- O

gelatine O

to O
create O
` O

among O

They O
believed O
that O
the O
motive O
could O
be O
to O
send O
a O

of O
their O
potential O
` O
to O
strike O

' O
anywhere O

the O

Although O

those O

last O
year O
and O
on O
the O
interrogation O
of O
arrested O
persons O
in O
Karnataka LOC_Accused
, O
the O

believe O
that O

in O

have O
close O

with O

Bangalore LOC_Others

are O
being O

Recently O
, O
Raziuddin PER_Others
's O
elder O
brother O
Muqamuddin PER_Others
had O
been O
arrested O
in O
Hyderabad LOC_Others
for O
alleged O
terror O
links O
. O

` O
All O
this O
proves O
that O
the O
terror O
elements O
in O
the O
two O
states O
are O
operating O
as O
one O
group O
, O
' O
said O
another O
police O
official.According O
to O
sources O
, O
interrogation O
of O
suspects O
revealed O
that O
the O
October O
2005 O
attack O
on O
the O
STF ORG_Others
office O
in O
Hyderabad LOC_Victim
and O
the O
December O
attack O
in O
IISC ORG_Others
, ORG_Others
Bangalore ORG_Others
was O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
same O
elements O
. O

Another O
clear O
link O
between O
the O
terror O
elements O
in O
Andhra LOC_Others
and O
Karnataka LOC_Others
is O
the O
explosive O
material O
used O
in O
the O
blasts O
. O

In O
Friday O
's O
Bangalore LOC_Others
blasts O
, O
an O
explosive O
with O
an O
ammonium O
nitrate O
base O
was O
used O
, O
while O
in O
the O
Gokul ORG_Others
Chat ORG_Others
and O
Lumbini ORG_Others
Park ORG_Others
explosions O
in O
Hyderabad LOC_Others
last O
August O
, O
a O
similar O
ammonium O
nitrate O
base O
was O
used.The O
Andhra ORG_Others
police ORG_Others
are O
, O
however O
, O
yet O
to O
dismantle O
a O
single O
sleeper O
cell O
. O

` O
So O
many O
suspects O
have O
been O
rounded O
up O
in O
the O
Mecca LOC_Event
Masjid LOC_Event
and O
twin O
blasts O
last O
year O
. O

So O
many O
teams O
have O
sent O
across O
Karnataka LOC_Others
, O
Jaipur LOC_Others
and O
other O
blast O
sites O
, O
but O
not O
a O
single O
arrest O
directly O
related O
to O

could O
be O
made O
. O

This O
is O
very O
frustrating O
for O

, O
' O
a O
senior O

said.Based O
on O
preliminary O

the O

found O
some O
facts O

` O
One O
that O

` O
If O

NEW LOC_Others

: O
The O
security O
establishment O
was O
scrambling O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
any O
specific O
inputs O
that O
would O
give O
indications O
of O
who O
may O
have O
been O
behind O
the O
serial O
blasts O
that O
interrupted O
the O
past O
few O
months O
of O
lull O
from O
terror O
. O

Sources O
were O
veering O
around O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
underworld O
involvement O
was O
very O
high O
because O
of O
a O
host O
of O
factors O
. O

One O
official O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
underworld O
has O
been O
`` O
hyperactive O
'' O
in O
recent O
weeks O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O

There O
have O
been O
a O
number O
of O
reports O
about O
various O
developments O
in O
the O
underworld O
such O
as O
the O
killing O
of O
journalist O
J PER_Victim
Dey PER_Victim
and O
attacks O
on O
Dawood PER_Others
Ibrahim PER_Others
's O
brother O
's O
driver O
. O

Among O
the O
recent O
inputs O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
patch-up O
between O
some O
factions O
. O

Another O
analyst O
speculated O
that O
the O
simultaneous O
blasts O
required O
a O
fairly O
good O
network O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Others
as O
well O
as O
strong O
local O
support O
. O

He O
said O
it O
was O
likely O
that O
the O
blasts O
were O
executed O
by O
the O
underworld O
, O
financed O
by O
someone O
else O
. O

The O
attacks O
came O
just O
three O
days O
after O
the O
Centre O
issued O
a O
warning O
to O
Mumbai LOC_Event
, O
Hyderabad LOC_Others
, O
Bangalore LOC_Others
and O
Kolkata LOC_Others
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami ORG_Accused
( O
HuJI ORG_Accused
) O
conspiracy O
to O
target O
these O
cities O
. O

However O
, O
sources O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
much O
credence O
to O
this O
particular O
warning O
, O
which O
was O
based O
on O
inputs O
from O
BSF ORG_Others
. O

BSF ORG_Others
may O
have O
got O
its O
inputs O
from O
Bangladeshi O
sources O
. O

The O

was O
scrambling O
for O
any O
specific O
inputs O
that O
would O
give O
indications O
of O
who O
may O
have O
been O
behind O
the O
serial O
blasts O
. O

A O
third O
angle O
that O
is O
being O
closely O
looked O
at O
is O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
involvement O
of O
Kashmiri ORG_Others
terrorist ORG_Others
groups O
. O

The O
blasts O
came O
on O
July O
13 O
, O
which O
is O
observed O
as O
Kashmir O
Martyrs O
Day O
to O
commemorate O
the O
killing O
of O
22 O
Kashmiris O
by O
the O
Dogra ORG_Others
forces ORG_Others
in O
1931 O
. O

In O
the O
present O
phase O
of O
militancy O
that O
started O
in O
the O
late O
1980s O
, O
Martyrs O
Day O
has O
been O
appropriated O
significantly O
by O
the O
separatists O
and O
terrorist O
groups O
. O

One O
top O
official O
said O
the O
degraded O
capabilities O
of O
Kashmiri ORG_Others
militant ORG_Others
groups O
in O
recent O
times O
defy O
the O
logic O
of O
them O
carrying O
out O
multiple O
blasts O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Event
. O

However O
, O
the O
official O
said O
possibility O
of O
Lashkar-e-Toiba ORG_Accused
( O
LeT ORG_Others
) O
, O
which O
remains O
a O
very O
powerful O
terror O
group O
, O
carrying O
out O
the O
attack O
to O
coincide O
with O
July O
13 O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

Sources O
said O
they O
are O
seriously O
examining O
the O
possibility O
of O
Pakistan LOC_Others
backed O
groups O
, O
especially O
the O
LeT ORG_Accused
, O
carrying O
out O
the O
attack O
to O
divert O
attention O
away O
from O
the O
domestic O
woes O
of O
Pakistan LOC_Others
, O
and O
to O
warn O
that O
the O
Kashmir LOC_Others
issue O
was O
far O
from O
over O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
then O
the O
Indian ORG_Accused
Mujahideen ORG_Accused
, O
or O
other O
LeT ORG_Accused

may O

It O
was O

a O

The O

the O

The O
bombers O
also O
changed O
six O
mobile O
handsets O
to O
avoid O
leaving O
behind O
a O
trail O
of O
evidence O

The O
money O
for O
the O

out O
. O

Earlier O
, O
terror O
groups O
wanted O
their O
identity O
to O
be O
known O
since O
it O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
pride O
for O
them O
. O

However O
, O
the O
terror O
scenario O
has O
changed O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
terror O
groups O
prefer O
to O
keep O
their O
identity O
concealed O
. O

. O

. O

This O
change O
has O
basically O
made O
investigation O
a O
nightmare O
for O
the O
police O
. O

Blast O
cases O
will O
not O
be O
easy O
to O
investigate O
in O
the O
days O
to O
come O
. O

It O
has O
become O
a O
cat O
and O
mouse O
game O
between O
terror O
groups O
and O
the O
police O
and O
the O
latter O
are O
sure O
going O
to O
find O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
crack O
these O
cases O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

A O
police O
officer O
pointed O
out O
that O
nowadays O
with O
each O
blast O
the O
investigations O
need O
to O
start O
from O
scratch O
unlike O
the O
past O
where O
they O
could O
rely O
heavily O
on O
information O
obtained O
from O
earlier O
blasts O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

The O
blasts O
earlier O
had O
a O
connection O
and O
all O
the O
police O
needed O
to O
do O
was O
to O
join O
the O
dots O
. O

Moreover O
, O
when O
the O
Indian ORG_Others
Mujahideen ORG_Others
carried O
out O
blasts O
, O
they O
also O
gave O
the O
police O
the O
privilege O
of O
a O
full-fledged O
mail O
that O
gave O
the O
first O
lead O
. O

Now O
, O
this O
too O
is O
missing O
and O
terror O
groups O
have O
become O
smarter O
and O
try O
their O
best O
to O
conceal O
their O
identity O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

. O

. O

Police O
sources O
say O
that O
they O
will O
have O
to O
rely O
much O
more O
on O
human O
intelligence O
in O
the O
days O
to O
come O
. O

These O
blasts O
that O
are O
taking O
place O
may O
not O
be O
undertaken O
by O
full-fledged O
terror O
groups O
and O
could O
be O
the O
handiwork O
of O
one O
or O
two O
people O
. O

This O
would O
mean O
that O
the O
police O
will O
have O
go O
back O
and O
rely O
on O
age-old O
tactics O
to O
crack O
the O
case O
. O

This O
means O
they O
will O
have O
to O
activate O
their O
sources O
on O
the O
ground O
-LRB- O
anti-social O
elements O
-RRB- O
and O
seek O
information O
from O
them O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

They O
will O
also O
have O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
statements O
given O
by O
those O
people O
present O
before O
the O
blast O
to O
find O
out O
if O
they O
saw O
anything O
suspicious O
. O

. O

. O

. O

. O

Each O
of O
the O
latest O
incidents O
of O
terror O
would O
need O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
fresh O
case O
and O
the O
investigations O
need O
to O
be O
independent O
in O
nature O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
in O
relying O
on O
signatures O
and O
also O
information O
from O
previous O
blasts O
. O

One O
thing O
is O
clear O
that O
none O
of O
these O

The O

the O

the O
frequent O

the O

only O
ends O
up O
irritating O
the O

blame O

the O

Adding O
to O
the O
surreal O
feel O
of O
it O
all O
are O
the O
TV O

who O
have O
been O
running O

their O

everyone O
by O
surprise O

The O
terrorists O
had O
planted O
the O
bombs O
on O
bicycles O
, O
parked O
about O
150 O
metres O
from O
each O

close O
to O
an O

and O
a O

Three O

after O
the O

, O
a O
senior O

officer O
told O
Firstpost O
that O
they O
`` O
are O
groping O

The O
situation O
immediately O
after O
the O
twin O
blasts O
was O
n't O
easy O
for O
the O
police O
. O

The O
commotion O
in O
the O
area O
meant O
it O
was O
a O
herculean O
task O
shifting O
the O
injured O
to O
the O
nearby O
hospitals O
. O

There O
was O
blood O
all O
over O
, O
people O
writhing O
in O
pain O
, O
crying O
. O

There O
were O
glass O
pieces O
and O

strewn O
around O
and O
curious O
onlookers O
and O
the O

teams O
did O
not O
make O
it O
any O
easier O
. O

With O
cellphones O
jammed O
, O
people O
were O
travelling O
to O
Dilsukhnagar LOC_Event
to O
find O
out O
about O
their O
near O
and O
dear O

. O

Politicians O
who O
thronged O
the O
blast O
site O
with O
their O
slogan-shouting O
supporters O
only O
meant O
the O
police O
became O
more O
engrossed O
in O
ensuring O
their O
security O
and O
not O
in O
keeping O
the O

sterile O

Police O

now O
have O
to O
track O
the O

that O

out O
of O
Hyderabad LOC_Event
prior O
to O
the O

That O

existed O
in O

of O
Hyderabad LOC_Event
as O

as O
neighbouring O

like O
Nalgonda LOC_Others
is O
a O
well-known O
fact O
and O
the O
sleuths O
will O
have O
to O
dig O

find O
which O
of O
those O

were O
activated O
in O
the O
recent O

. O

The O
police O
is O
also O
nervous O
about O
having O
lost O
significant O
forensic O
evidence O
in O
the O
melee O
that O
followed O
the O

. O

This O
evidence O
will O
be O
critical O
in O
pointing O
to O
the O
kind O
of O
bomb O
that O
was O
assembled O
which O
would O
further O
help O
in O
identifying O
the O
terror O
group O
. O

. O

. O

Conspiracy O
theories O
are O
pointing O
to O
how O
the O
terrorists O
would O
have O
wanted O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
communal O
tension O
created O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O

The O

is O
to O
stand O
up O
united O
to O
defeat O
those O
designs O
of O
the O

We O

why O
was O
there O
no O

the O
Andhra LOC_Event

The O

but O
the O

says O
it O
had O
not O
received O
any O

It O
was O
the O
third O
time O
in O

that O
Dilsukhnagar LOC_Others

been O
targeted O

The O

a O

at O
the O

Dilsukhnagar LOC_Others
, O
but O
it O
was O
detected O

, O
five O

the O

. O

Why O
do O
the O
terror O
planners O
keep O
returning O
to O
Dilsukhnagar LOC_Others
? LOC_Others
Is O
it O
because O
of O
the O

that O

after O
which O
the O

the O
Land O

The O
revelation O
came O
to O
light O
after O
one O
of O
the O
three O

city LOC_Others
during O
a O

the O
word O

The O
bombs O
were O
small O

liquefied O
petroleum O

cylinders O

contained O
ammonium O

They O
were O

but O
they O
exploded O
12 O
hours O
early O
in O
damp O
conditions O
, O
according O
to O

There O
is O
evidence O
that O
a O
fusion O
of O
low O

high-intensity O
bomb-making O
technique O
was O
used O
, O
said O
Bihar LOC_Others
director O

We O
can O

Such O

The O
investigating O

believe O
the O
bombs O
could O
have O
been O
planted O
by O
terrorists O
wearing O
yellow O

to O
escape O

They O
also O
believe O
the O

Investigators O
also O
recovered O
three O
hand-written O

written O

While O
two O
of O

mention O

the O

where O
the O

apparently O
to O

Sources O
said O
the O

were O

that O

The O
powerful O

This O

What O

the O

Four O

Ansari PER_Accused
, O
a O
resident O
of O
Ranchi LOC_Accused
, O
was O
apprehended O
at O
the O
railway O
station O
just O
after O
the O
first O
two O
bombs O
went O
off O

He O
was O
apparently O
planning O
to O
plant O
some O
more O

panicked O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
police O

On O
being O
challenged O
, O
he O
tried O
to O
flee O

The O

then O
got O
incredibly O
lucky O
. O

Ansari PER_Accused
had O
been O
asked O
by O
his O
handlers O
not O
to O
carry O
a O
mobile O
phone O
. O

So O
he O
had O
jotted O
down O
phone O
numbers O
of O
a O
dozen O
conspirators O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
, O
which O
fell O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O

helped O
them O
track O
down O
some O
of O
the O
others O

One O
of O
them O
, O
Ainul PER_Accused

who O

was O
initially O
believed O
to O
be O
a O

that O
he O
was O
also O

The O
remaining O
two O

The O

officially O
said O
there O
was O
only O
one O
blast O
inside O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
but O
sources O
insisted O
there O
were O
two O
. O

A O
bigger O
tragedy O
was O
averted O
only O
because O
the O
fortitude O
of O
the O
massive O
crowd O
ensured O
that O
there O
was O
no O

a O

Well O

we O
do O
not O
know O
the O
truth O
yet O
, O
but O
there O
's O
little O
to O
trust O
this O
spin O
because O
it O
tries O
to O
deflect O
attention O
from O
the O
actual O
conspiracy O
and O
subtly O
justify O
the O
crime.First O
, O
the O
purpose O
was O
to O
kill O
some O

in O

and O
trigger O
a O

that O
killed O
scores O
, O
scare O

That O
the O

may O

PTIIt O
was O
no O

All O

When O

prop O
up O
the O

they O
forget O
that O
an O

an O
attack O
on O

this O

there O

an O

it O

That O

the O

told O
them O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
pre-Diwali O

But O
news O
did O
reach O
the O
stage O
that O

because O

This O

what O

With O
the O
kind O
of O

simply O
cancelling O
