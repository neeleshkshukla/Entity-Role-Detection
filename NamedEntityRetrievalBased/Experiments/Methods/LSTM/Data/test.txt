theory O
, O
the O
bomb O

the O

Another O
is O
that O
the O
crude O

was O
not O
meant O

cause O
any O

could O
be O
the O

We O

on O
the O

that O

However O
, O
they O
are O

` O
When O

they O
must O
be O

will O

' O

. O

Another O
angle O
police O
are O
focussing O
on O
is O
the O
possible O

of O

to O
the O

in O

HYDERABAD LOC_Event
: O
Why O
did O
the O
Andhra LOC_Others
Pradesh LOC_Others
police O
ignore O
the O
specific O
alert O
by O
the O
Intelligence ORG_Others
Bureau ORG_Others
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
terror O
strike O
in O
Hyderabad LOC_Event
? O
. O

. O

The O
immediate O
answer O
from O
the O
police O
top O
brass O
to O
this O
disturbing O
query O
is O
that O
the O
IB ORG_Others
alert O
to O
the O
State O
police O
intelligence O
wing O
was O
too O
vague O
and O
not O
apparently O
considered O
an O
actionable O
intelligence O
input O
. O

. O

. O

The O
alert O
, O
according O
to O
reliable O
sources O
, O
was O
based O
on O
telephone O
surveillance O
of O
suspects O
and O
had O
warned O
that O
the O
ISI-backed O
fundamentalist O
modules O
could O
take O
up O
some O
sensational O
terrorist O
acts O
in O
Mumbai LOC_Others
, O
Bangalore LOC_Others
and/or O
Hyderabad LOC_Event
. O

The O
alert O
had O
also O
indicated O
that O
the O
modules O
were O
waiting O
for O
two O
or O
three O
people O
to O
come O
from O
Bangladesh LOC_Others
-LSB- O
for O
organising O
blasts O
-RSB- O
. O

. O

. O

Such O
alerts O
are O
brought O
to O
the O
notice O
of O
the O
top O
brass O
of O
the O
city O
and O
state O
police O
and O
especially O
the O
Counter ORG_Others
Intelligence ORG_Others
-LRB- O
CI ORG_Others
-RRB- O
cell O
which O
monitors O
the O
terrorist O
activities O
. O

What O
follow-up O
action O
could O
have O
been O
initiated O
over O
such O
a O
vague O
alert O
is O
the O
question O
now O
doing O
the O
rounds O
, O
even O
as O
a O
political O
storm O
continues O
to O
rage O
over O
the O
IB ORG_Others
alert O
being O
neglected O
by O
the O
Andhra LOC_Event
Pradesh LOC_Event
police O
. O

. O

. O

Knowledgeable O
sources O
privy O
to O
the O
back-end O
operations O
say O
that O
some O
proactive O
action O
should O
have O
been O
there O
considering O
that O
such O
an O
alert O
had O
come O
just O
two O
months O
after O
the O
bomb O
blast O
in O
Mecca LOC_Others
Masjid LOC_Others
which O
killed O
nine O
persons O
and O
five O
more O
in O
the O
consequent O
police O
firing O
in O
the O
old O
city O
to O
quell O
riotous O
mobs O
. O

. O

. O

Actionable O
angle O
. O

. O

The O
follow-up O
could O
have O
been O
getting O
back O
to O
the O
IB ORG_Others
posing O
questions O
on O
what O
the O
actionable O
angle O
was O
in O
the O
alert O
. O

Senior O
police O
officers O
recall O
that O
there O
were O
many O
instances O
when O
the O
State O
intelligence O
officials O
got O
back O
to O
the O
IB ORG_Others
seeking O
more O
information O
on O
the O
actionable O
angle O
and O
following O
it O
up O
with O
patience O
, O
many O
a O
time O
leading O
to O
success O
. O

. O

. O

Remarkable O
work O
. O

. O

The O
much-criticised O
Counter ORG_Others
Intelligence ORG_Others
-LRB- O
CI ORG_Others
-RRB- O
cell O
had O
indeed O
turned O
out O
some O
remarkable O
work O
in O
recent O
times O
, O
the O
latest O
being O
the O
busting O
of O
an O
international O
counterfeit O
currency O
racket O
leading O
to O
the O
seizure O
of O
Pakistani-printed O
Indian O
currency O
worth O
Rs O
. O

2.36 O
crore O
and O
the O
arrest O
of O
four O
persons O
including O
a O
Dubai LOC_Others
national O
on O
the O
same O
day O
when O
the O
twin O
bombs O
exploded O
in O
Hyderabad LOC_Event
. O

. O

. O

However O
, O
officials O
concede O
that O
the O
competency O
of O
the O
CI ORG_Others
cell O
would O
depend O
on O
many O
parameters O
. O

When O
the O
fundamentalist O
organisations O
were O
increasingly O
depending O
on O
the O
Internet O
, O
while O
discarding O
mobile O
telephones O
for O
communication O
, O
the O
intelligence O
wing O
does O
not O
have O
the O
wherewithal O
to O
track O
web-based O
communication O
. O

Compounding O
this O
, O
maintaining O
physical O
surveillance O
on O
suspects O
has O
almost O
been O
given O
up O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
. O

. O

. O

Three O
factors O
. O

. O

Then O
why O
this O
marked O
disinterest O
in O
the O
alert O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
terror O
strike O
? O
Police O
officials O
attribute O
this O
to O
three O
major O
factors O
. O

Firstly O
, O
a O
general O
disinterest O
among O
the O
police O
, O
especially O
those O
involved O
in O
counter O
intelligence O
work O
following O
a O
soft O
stand O
adopted O
by O
the O
government O
towards O
fundamentalists O
for O
political O
reasons O
; O
insensitivity O
and O
ignorance O
of O
the O
police O
top O
brass O
towards O
the O
nature O
of O
counter O
intelligence O
work O
; O
and O
the O
general O
tendency O
of O
the O
police O
department O
to O
ignore O
the O
security O
needs O
of O
officers O
who O
have O
been O
exposed O
to O
threats O
from O
the O
modules O
. O

. O

. O

With O
such O
a O
perception O
strengthening O
, O
officers O
take O
things O
easy O
and O
the O
result O
is O
there O
for O
everyone O
to O
see O
, O
a O
senior O
police O
officer O
says O
. O

Another O

Confession O
. O

. O

During O
a O
closer O
interrogation O
of O
Ibrahim PER_Others

, O
he O
confessed O
that O
he O

about O

has O

. O

. O

. O

The O
incident O
underscores O
several O
important O
points O
. O

First O
, O
it O
points O
to O
the O
substantially O
degraded O
capability O
of O
the O
Indian ORG_Accused
Mujahideen ORG_Accused
, O
a O
homegrown O
terror O
network O
that O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
this O
act O
in O
its O
trademark O
email O
, O
which O
was O
sent O
from O
Mallad LOC_Others
, O
Mumbai LOC_Others
. O

. O

. O

Although O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
is O
a O
chilling O
reminder O
from O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
that O
its O
still O
around O
, O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
outfit O
continues O
to O
be O
crippled O
, O
weak O
and O
disorganized O
since O
Indian ORG_Others
security ORG_Others
forces ORG_Others
broke O
its O
backbone O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
after O
a O
spate O
of O
bloody O
attacks O
across O
the O
country O
. O

. O

. O

There O
are O
three O
clues O
to O
the O
changethe O
timing O
of O
the O
blast O
, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
explosive O
device O
used O
and O
the O
modus O
operandi O
. O

. O

. O

First O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Mujahideens O
email O
, O
the O
Varanasi LOC_Event
blast O
was O
an O
act O
of O
retaliation O
against O
the O
demolition O
of O
the O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjid LOC_Others
( O
Mosque O
) O
back O
in O
December O
6 O
, O
1992 O
. O

But O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
perpetrators O
couldnt O
execute O
their O
work O
on O
the O
actual O
18th O
anniversary O
of O
Babri LOC_Others
Masjids LOC_Others
destruction O
on O
December O
6 O
points O
to O
some O
definite O
chinks O
in O
the O
IMs O
armour O
. O

Clearly O
, O
the O
terrorists O
were O
n't O
confident O
they O
could O
pull O
off O
a O
more O
symbolic O
attack O
on O
the O
actual O
day O
and O
so O
decided O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
. O

. O

. O

Second O
, O
the O
improvised O
explosive O
device O
( O
IED O
) O
used O
in O
the O
attack O
, O
which O
was O
hidden O
in O
a O
milk O
container O
, O
was O
a O
low O
intensity O
one O
and O
didnt O
have O
shrapnel O
or O
other O
projectiles O
like O
nails O
to O
maximize O
the O
kill O
quotient O
. O

The O
explosion O
did O
cause O
the O
tragic O
death O
of O
a O
toddler O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
nearly O
40 O
injured O
were O
able O
to O
escape O
with O
their O
lives O
. O

Had O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
been O
at O
its O
historic O
deadliest O
, O
the O
number O
of O
fatalities O
in O
Varanasi LOC_Event
could O
well O
have O
reached O
three O
figures O
, O
especially O
considering O
that O
thousands O
of O
devotees O
were O
present O
at O
the O
Sheetla LOC_Others
Ghat LOC_Others
( O
memorial O
) O
at O
around O
6:30 O
pm O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
two O
explosions O
that O
rocked O
Varanasi LOC_Others
previously O
on O
March O
7 O
, O
2006 O
killed O
28 O
people O
. O

. O

. O

The O
single O
blast O
on O
December O
7 O
therefore O
makes O
it O
pretty O
clear O
that O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
's O
capabilities O
have O
been O
substantially O
eroded O
since O
March O
2006 O
. O

Cobbling O
together O
a O
crude O
device O
and O
hiding O
it O
in O
a O
milk O
container O
at O
a O
crowded O
religious O
place O
is O
n't O
rocket O
science O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
require O
specialists O
to O
plan O
and O
execute O
. O

. O

. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
attack O
by O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
since O
February O
, O
when O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
people O
were O
killed O
in O
a O
German O
bakery-restaurant O
in O
Pune LOC_Others
and O
two O
Taiwanese O
tourists O
were O
shot O
at O
in O
Old LOC_Others
Delhi LOC_Others
on O
September O
19 O
, O
an O
act O
largely O
aimed O
at O
disrupting O
the O
Commonwealth O
Games O
. O

. O

. O

But O
this O
latest O
incident O
suggests O
IM ORG_Accused
executed O
a O
hurried O
and O
ill-prepared O
plot O
more O
to O
show O
their O
presence O
to O
their O
alleged O
Pakistani O
masters O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

Its O
probably O
their O
way O
of O
telling O
their O
believed O
handlers O
in O
Pakistan LOC_Others
that O
they O
still O
have O
the O
guts O
, O
gall O
and O
grit O
and O
could O
do O
better O
if O
they O
had O
more O
funds O
. O

Indian O
security O
managers O
must O
take O
this O
cue O
. O

. O

. O

. O

all O

with O

who O

and O

, O
shifted O
the O
responsibility O
on O
the O
state O
saying O
it O
was O
a O
failure O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
UP ORG_Others

which O

We O

on O

25 O
, O

to O
share O

at O
the O
possibility O
of O
terrorist O
outfits O
targeting O
this O
particular O
ghat O
of O
Varanasi LOC_Others
, O
Chidambaram PER_Others
said.Since O
the O
warning O
had O
been O
conveyed O
to O

in O
advance O
and O
that O
too O
specifically O
about O
a O
possible O
strike O
at O
Dasashwamedh LOC_Others
Ghat LOC_Others
, O
we O
expected O
them O
to O
take O
appropriate O

measures O
. O

It O
was O
the O
result O
of O
some O
security O
lapse O
on O
the O
part O

the O
state O
administration O
, O
he O
added.Chidambaram O
also O
sounded O

grim O
warning O
that O
we O
should O
not O

the O
nature O

But O
there O

no O

seem O

innocent O

that O

a O
completely O

These O

even O
if O
that O

the O

they O
add O
to O
the O

which O

the O

He O
said O
the O

investigatiing O
it O
thoroughly O

Two O
mohalla O

had O
stepped O
into O
the O
field O
and O
were O
rolling O
out O
the O
mat O
when O
two O
unfamiliar O
, O
clean-shaven O
men O
carrying O
cricket O
kits O
walked O
towards O
them O
. O

For O
a O
moment O
, O
it O
appeared O
two O
cricket O
enthusiasts O
were O
looking O
to O
play O
on O
the O
Police LOC_Event
Public LOC_Event
School LOC_Event
ground O
in O
Srinagar LOC_Event
, O
near O
a O

The O
two O

then O
dropped O

into O

Out O
came O
from O
the O

AK-47 O
guns O
and O
from O
the O

By O

time O
the O

fell O
silent O
after O
30 O

CRPF ORG_Victim
jawans O
and O
the O
two O
men O
lay O
dead O
and O
10 O
persons O
, O
including O
three O
young O
players O
, O
were O
injured O
. O

It O
was O
a O
fidayeen O
attack O
, O
the O
first O
in O
Srinagar LOC_Event
in O
over O
three O
years O
and O
executed O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
makes O
every O
normal O
feature O
of O
civilian O
life O
a O
potential O
threat O
to O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

When O
the O
gunfire O
began O
, O
a O
CRPF ORG_Victim
reserve O
party O
was O
killing O
time O
on O
the O
lawns O
, O
several O
jawans O
playing O
cards O
. O

The O
premises O
were O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
in O
Kashmir LOC_Others
because O
the O
school O
is O
sandwiched O
between O
a O
CRPF O
camp O
and O
police O
residential O
quarters O
. O

No O
child O
or O
teacher O
was O
in O
the O
school O
because O
of O
a O
shutdown O
called O
by O
separatists O
to O
seek O
the O
body O
of O
Afzal PER_Others
Guru PER_Others
, O
the O
Parliament O
attack O
convict O
who O
was O
hanged O
in O
New LOC_Others
Delhi LOC_Others
on O
February O
16 O
. O

Several O
factors O
that O
swirled O
around O
the O
fidayeen O
attack O
today O
appeared O
to O
suggest O
Afzals O
execution O
has O
made O
Kashmir LOC_Others
a O
deeper O
quagmire O
for O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

The O
CRPF ORG_Victim
reserve O
squad O
was O
awaiting O
deployment O
to O
quell O
the O
citys O
stone-throwing O
protesters O
, O
whose O
ranks O
have O
swelled O
afresh O
after O
the O
hanging O
of O
Afzal O
. O

The O
attack O
that O
began O
at O
10.45 O
am O
came O
weeks O
after O
top O
militant O
groups O
vowed O
to O
avenge O
the O
execution O
of O
Afzal PER_Others
. O

The O
situation O
on O
the O
ground O
appeared O
so O
inflamed O
that O
some O
protesters O
threw O
stones O
at O
the O
security O
forces O
at O
Bemina LOC_Event
, O
the O
site O
of O
todays O
fidayeen O
attack O
, O
even O
when O
the O
operation O
against O
the O
militants O
was O
in O
progress O
. O

Another O
target O
of O
the O
stones O
was O
a O
CRPF ORG_Victim
vehicle O
ferrying O
back O
from O
hospital O
jawans O
who O
donated O
blood O
for O
those O
injured O
in O
the O
attack O
. O

The O
CRPF ORG_Victim
opened O
fire O
and O
killed O
a O
youth O
, O
inflaming O
passions O
further O
. O

One O
of O
the O
players O
on O
the O
field O
said O
the O
militants O
lobbed O
grenades O
and O
fired O
indiscriminately O
at O
the O
CRPF ORG_Victim
jawans O
. O

The O
scenes O
that O
unfolded O
resembled O
signature O
television O
footage O
from O
urban O
conflict O
zones O
uniformed O
forces O
taking O
position O
, O
falling O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
rolling O
over O
, O
firing O
on O
the O
trot O
and O
screaming O
into O
what O
looked O
like O
mobile O
phones O
. O

The O
bodies O
of O
some O
jawans O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
telltale O
sign O
of O
the O
end O
to O
the O
battle O
came O
when O
jawans O
carried O
out O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
militants O
, O
one O
wearing O
a O
red O
outfit O
. O

All O
of O
us O
knelt O
and O
feared O
our O
end O
has O
come O
. O

The O
firing O
and O
explosions O
left O
us O
breathless O
for O
some O
time O
. O

For O
just O
10 O
seconds O
or O
so O
the O
firing O
stopped O
and O
some O
of O
us O
ran O
to O
the O
fence O
, O
climbed O
it O
and O
crossed O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

I O
now O
realise O
it O
was O
madness O
because O
we O
could O
have O
been O
shot O
while O
climbing O
, O
he O
said O
, O
requesting O
not O
to O
be O
named O
. O

On O
record O
, O
the O
players O
all O
in O
the O
early O
twenties O
refused O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
saw O
the O
militants O
, O
probably O
for O
fear O
of O
being O
targeted O
by O
the O
security O
forces O
. O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
save O
myself O
and O
my O
friends O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

I O
did O
not O
see O
the O
militants O
entering O
the O
play O
ground O
. O

I O
lost O
my O
senses O
because O
of O
the O
firing O
, O
said O
Obaid O

one O
of O
the O
injured O
youths O
. O

Mudassir PER_Victim
Wani PER_Victim
, O
who O
was O
also O
injured O
, O
said O
he O
did O
not O
realise O
he O
was O
injured O
possibly O
by O
splinters O
when O
he O
began O
running O
out O
of O
the O
field O
. O

We O
were O
busy O
laying O
the O
mat O
on O
the O
pitch O
and O
blasts O
and O
gunfire O
rang O
out O
. O

We O
fled O
the O
spot O
. O

Some O
people O
came O
to O
my O
rescue O
and O
shifted O
me O
to O
the O

after O
I O
saw O
blood O
oozing O
from O

The O
emerging O
leads O
in O
the O
serial O
blasts O
during O
Modis O
Hunkar O
rally O
in O
Patna LOC_Others
are O
surely O
disturbing O
for O
Chief O
Minister O
Nitish PER_Others

Preliminary O
investigations O
point O

a O
conspiracy O

The O
serial O
blasts O
raise O
far O
more O
serious O
questions O
on O
what O
kind O
of O
turn O
this O
gives O
to O
the O
2014 O
Lok O
Sabha O
elections O
. O

The O
political O
atmosphere O
is O
already O
charged O
and O
bitter O
, O
it O
is O
now O
bloodied O
. O

If O
this O
is O
not O
cracked O
now O
then O
as O
electioneering O
gets O
more O
heated O
, O
there O
could O
be O
a O
possibility O
of O
further O
strikes O
and O
consequent O
violence O
, O
possibly O
social O
tension O
. O

The O
suspected O
involvement O
of O
the O
IM ORG_Accused
adds O
a O
terror O
angle O
to O
the O
existing O
Naxal O
violence O
and O
their O
continued O
inclination O
to O
influence O
the O
voting O
pattern O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
talk O
in O
political O
and O
bureaucratic O
circles O
over O
the O
way O
the O
two O
leaders O
, O
Narendra PER_Others
Modi PER_Others
and O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
, O
reacted O
to O
the O
situation O
on O
Sunday O
. O

By O
the O
time O
Modi O
landed O
at O
Patna LOC_Others
airport O
at12 O
.15 O
pm O
, O
three O
blasts O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

The O
IB ORG_Others
informed O
the O
accompanying O
Gujarat LOC_Others
police O
and O
NSG O
officers O
of O
the O
incident O
and O
thereafter O
Modi PER_Others
was O
duly O
informed O
of O
it O
by O
the O
IB ORG_Others
station O
head O
in O
Patna LOC_Others
, O
incidentally O
a O
Gujarat LOC_Others
cadre O
IPS O
Vivek PER_Others
Shrivastava PER_Others
. O

Modi PER_Others
was O
told O
of O
the O
kind O
of O
threat O
perception O
he O
had O
and O
was O
requested O
to O
drop O
the O
idea O
of O
addressing O
the O
rally O
. O

Modi PER_Others
remained O
unmoved O
and O
after O
a O
quick O
discussion O
with O
Gujarat LOC_Others
police O
officers O
he O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
will O
proceed O
to O
the O
venue O
, O
address O
the O
rally O
in O
his O
usual O
flair O
, O
make O
it O
appear O
as O
if O
this O
was O
business O
as O
usual O
. O

It O
was O
again O
decided O
at O
the O
airport O
itself O
that O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
on O
the O
podium O
in O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
would O
handle O
it O
smartly O
, O
not O
allow O
any O
kind O
of O
panic O
to O
prevail O
and O
keep O
telling O
the O
audience O
that O
these O
were O
only O
firecrackers O
and O
would O
appeal O
to O
them O
not O
to O
burst O
them O
. O

The O
BJP ORG_Others
leaders O
' O
assessment O
was O
that O
the O
low O
intensity O
blasts O
at O
the O
railway O
station O
and O
at O
other O
points O
in O
and O
around O
Gandhi LOC_Others
Maidan LOC_Others
were O
intended O
to O
create O
panic O
and O
cause O
a O
stampede O
. O

The O
success O
of O
the O
Hunkar O
rally O
and O
the O
way O
Modi O
attacked O
Nitish PER_Others
during O
his O
one-hour O
speech O
has O
hugely O
dented O
Nitishs O
electoral O
prospects O
. O

Nitish O
will O
devise O
ways O
and O
means O
to O
fight O
that O
out O
politically O
, O
and O
first O
retaliation O
could O
be O
expected O
on O
30 O
October O
when O
he O
addresses O
a O
convention O
against O
communalism O
( O
a O
euphemism O
for O
a O
potential O
anti-Modi O
front O
) O
in O
Delhi LOC_Others
. O

But O
then O
his O
capacity O
to O
respond O
effectively O
has O
seriously O
been O
challenged O
by O
the O
serial O
blasts O
. O

The O
states O
inept O
handling O
is O
sharpened O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Nitish PER_Others
has O
retained O
the O
home O
department O
portfolio O
since O
he O
came O
to O
power O
eight O
years O
ago O
. O

Firstpost O
spoke O
to O
some O
leaders O
, O
bureaucrats O
, O
intelligence O
and O
security O
officials O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
. O

There O
is O
a O
near O
unanimity O
in O
their O
opinion O
that O
the O
incident O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
embarrassment O
for O
the O
chief O
minister O
Nitish PER_Others
Kumar PER_Others
, O
not O
so O
much O
because O
it O
happened O
in O
Patna LOC_Others
during O
a O
rally O
of O
the O
BJPs ORG_Others
prime O
ministerial O
candidate O
but O
because O
of O
his O
continued O
handling O
of O
terror-related O
issues O
with O
kid O
gloves O
, O
more O
specifically O
when O
it O
concerns O
the O
homegrown O
IM ORG_Accused
module O
. O

An O
Intelligence O
officer O
posted O
in O
Bihar LOC_Others
is O
deeply O
upset O
with O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
Bihar ORG_Others
government ORG_Others
in O
dealing O
with O
security O
issues O
. O

He O
said O
Nitishs O
government O
has O
consistently O
turned O
a O
blind O
eye O
to O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
Darbhanga LOC_Others
module O
of O
the O
IM ORG_Others
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
it O
completely O
detached O
itself O
from O
the O
investigations O
in O
the O
Bodh LOC_Event
Gaya LOC_Event
serial O
blasts O
and O
its O
escapist O
act O
after O
the O
arrest O
of O
Bhatkal PER_Accused
. O

Only O
few O
months O
ago O
when O
the O
nation O
hailed O
the O
IB O
for O
getting O
its O
biggest O
catch O
, O
the O
Bihar ORG_Others
government ORG_Others
withheld O
state O
police O
from O
interrogating O
Bhatkal.Never O
before O
has O
a O
state O
government O
looked O
so O
deeply O
embarrassed O
to O
claim O
credit O
, O
which O
was O
being O
conferred O
on O
it O
. O

The O
obvious O
reasons O
for O
going O
soft O
against O
these O
terrorists O
and O
further O
investigations O
was O
that O
the O
police O
would O
then O
have O
to O
proceed O
against O
boys O
and O
men O
from O
the O
state O
, O
picking O
them O
up O
and O
charging O
them O
with O
serious O
terror O
related O
offences O
thereby O
inviting O
ire O
of O
the O
Muslim O
community O
. O

The O
morale O
of O
intelligence O
and O
security O
officers O
is O
low O
. O

Nitish PER_Others
had O
sharply O
criticised O
the O
NIA ORG_Others
and O
other O
state ORG_Others
police ORG_Others
agencies O
for O
picking O
up O
Muslim O
boys O
on O
alleged O
terror O
charges O
. O

Nitish PER_Others
has O
called O
the O
blasts O
a O
blot O
on O
Bihar LOC_Others
and O
later O
assured O
BJP ORG_Others
president O
Rajnath PER_Others
Singh PER_Others
over O
phone O
that O
he O
would O
ensure O
that O
the O
culprits O
are O
booked O
in O
the O
next O
two-three O
days O
, O
but O
the O
problems O
for O
him O
are O
multiple O
, O
both O
administratively O
and O
politically O
. O

LK PER_Others
Advani PER_Others
had O
also O
spoken O
to O
him O
about O
the O
incident O
. O

Nitish PER_Others
then O
thought O
it O
prudent O
to O
call O
Rajnath PER_Others
Singh PER_Others
at O
night O
to O
convey O
his O
concerns O
and O
tell O
him O
the O
state O
government O
was O
doing O
a O
speedy O
investigation O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
this O
was O
his O
first O
conversation O
with O
a O
senior O
BJP ORG_Others
leader O
since O
the O
time O
he O
suo-moto O
severed O
his O
17-year-old O
ties O
with O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O

Nitish O
is O
suddenly O
finding O
himself O
to O
be O
on O
a O
slippery O
wicket O
. O

After O
Modis O
forceful O
speech O
at O
Hunkar LOC_Others
rally O
, O
there O
have O
been O
voices O
within O
JD O
( O
U O
) O
questioning O
Nitishs O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
dump O
the O
BJP ORG_Others
. O

He O
has O
committed O
harakiri O
, O
they O
say O
. O

Too O
early O
to O
reach O
that O
conclusion O
, O
but O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
these O
should O
worrisome O
signs O
for O
Nitish PER_Others
. O
